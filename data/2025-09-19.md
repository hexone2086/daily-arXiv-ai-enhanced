### [1] [Class-invariant Test-Time Augmentation for Domain Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14420)
*Zhicheng Lin,Xiaolin Wu,Xi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种轻量级的测试时增强技术CI-TTA，通过生成类别不变的图像变体并聚合预测结果，有效提升模型在分布偏移下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度模型在分布偏移下性能会显著下降，预期通过轻量级的测试时增强技术来补充现有域适应方法的不足。

Method: 提出Class-Invariant Test-Time Augmentation (CI-TTA)，使用弹性和网格变形生成保持类别不变的图像变体，通过信心引导的筛选机制聚合可靠预测结果。

Result: 在PACS和Office-Home数据集上进行了涉及不同DG算法和背榜网络的广泛实验，都得到了一致的性能提升。

Conclusion: CI-TTA技术有效且通用，能够在不需要多域训练或计算密集的测试时适应的情况下，提升模型在未见域上的演继性能。

Abstract: Deep models often suffer significant performance degradation under
distribution shifts. Domain generalization (DG) seeks to mitigate this
challenge by enabling models to generalize to unseen domains. Most prior
approaches rely on multi-domain training or computationally intensive test-time
adaptation. In contrast, we propose a complementary strategy: lightweight
test-time augmentation. Specifically, we develop a novel Class-Invariant
Test-Time Augmentation (CI-TTA) technique. The idea is to generate multiple
variants of each input image through elastic and grid deformations that
nevertheless belong to the same class as the original input. Their predictions
are aggregated through a confidence-guided filtering scheme that remove
unreliable outputs, ensuring the final decision relies on consistent and
trustworthy cues. Extensive Experiments on PACS and Office-Home datasets
demonstrate consistent gains across different DG algorithms and backbones,
highlighting the effectiveness and generality of our approach.

### [2] [AToken: A Unified Tokenizer for Vision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14476)
*Jiasen Lu,Liangchen Song,Mingze Xu,Byeongjoo Ahn,Yanjun Wang,Chen Chen,Afshin Dehghan,Yinfei Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AToken是首个统一的视觉分词器，能够在图像、视频和3D资产上同时实现高保真重建和语义理解，通过4D潜在空间统一多种模态和任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分词器要么专注于单一模态的重建任务，要么专注于理解任务，缺乏一个能够统一处理多种视觉模态并同时支持重建和理解任务的框架。

Method: 采用纯Transformer架构和4D旋转位置编码来处理任意分辨率和时长的视觉输入；使用无对抗训练目标结合感知损失和Gram矩阵损失；采用渐进式训练课程从单图像扩展到视频和3D；支持连续和离散潜在token。

Result: 在图像上达到0.21 rFID和82.2% ImageNet准确率；视频上达到3.01 rFVD和32.6% MSRVTT检索率；3D上达到28.19 PSNR和90.9%分类准确率；在下游生成和理解任务中都表现出竞争力。

Conclusion: AToken为构建下一代多模态AI系统提供了统一的视觉分词基础，证明了在单一框架中统一多种视觉模态和任务的可行性。

Abstract: We present AToken, the first unified visual tokenizer that achieves both
high-fidelity reconstruction and semantic understanding across images, videos,
and 3D assets. Unlike existing tokenizers that specialize in either
reconstruction or understanding for single modalities, AToken encodes these
diverse visual inputs into a shared 4D latent space, unifying both tasks and
modalities in a single framework. Specifically, we introduce a pure transformer
architecture with 4D rotary position embeddings to process visual inputs of
arbitrary resolutions and temporal durations. To ensure stable training, we
introduce an adversarial-free training objective that combines perceptual and
Gram matrix losses, achieving state-of-the-art reconstruction quality. By
employing a progressive training curriculum, AToken gradually expands from
single images, videos, and 3D, and supports both continuous and discrete latent
tokens. AToken achieves 0.21 rFID with 82.2% ImageNet accuracy for images, 3.01
rFVD with 32.6% MSRVTT retrieval for videos, and 28.19 PSNR with 90.9%
classification accuracy for 3D. In downstream applications, AToken enables both
visual generation tasks (e.g., image generation with continuous and discrete
tokens, text-to-video generation, image-to-3D synthesis) and understanding
tasks (e.g., multimodal LLMs), achieving competitive performance across all
benchmarks. These results shed light on the next-generation multimodal AI
systems built upon unified visual tokenization.

### [3] [MemEvo: Memory-Evolving Incremental Multi-view Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14544)
*Zisen Kong,Bo Zhong,Pengyuan Li,Dongxia Chang,Yiming Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MemEvo方法解决增量多视图聚类中的稳定性-可塑性困境，通过模拟海马体-前额叶皮层协作记忆机制，实现新视图适应和历史知识保留的平衡


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决增量多视图聚类中的稳定性-可塑性困境(SPD)，模型需要足够可塑性适应新数据，同时保持足够稳定性巩固长期知识并防止灾难性遗忘

Method: 1) 海马体启发的视图对齐模块：通过连续表示中的结构对齐捕获新视图的增益信息；2) 认知遗忘机制：模拟人类记忆衰减模式调节历史知识权重；3) 前额叶皮层启发的知识巩固记忆模块：利用时间张量稳定性逐步巩固历史知识

Result: 在视图数量增长场景中展现出强大的知识保留能力，大量实验证明MemEvo相比现有最先进方法具有显著优势

Conclusion: MemEvo方法通过神经科学启发的记忆机制成功解决了增量多视图聚类中的稳定性-可塑性平衡问题

Abstract: Incremental multi-view clustering aims to achieve stable clustering results
while addressing the stability-plasticity dilemma (SPD) in incremental views.
At the core of SPD is the challenge that the model must have enough plasticity
to quickly adapt to new data, while maintaining sufficient stability to
consolidate long-term knowledge and prevent catastrophic forgetting. Inspired
by the hippocampal-prefrontal cortex collaborative memory mechanism in
neuroscience, we propose a Memory-Evolving Incremental Multi-view Clustering
method (MemEvo) to achieve this balance. First, we propose a
hippocampus-inspired view alignment module that captures the gain information
of new views by aligning structures in continuous representations. Second, we
introduce a cognitive forgetting mechanism that simulates the decay patterns of
human memory to modulate the weights of historical knowledge. Additionally, we
design a prefrontal cortex-inspired knowledge consolidation memory module that
leverages temporal tensor stability to gradually consolidate historical
knowledge. By integrating these modules, MemEvo achieves strong knowledge
retention capabilities in scenarios with a growing number of views. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MemEvo exhibits remarkable advantages over
existing state-of-the-art methods.

### [4] [Edge-Aware Normalized Attention for Efficient and Detail-Preserving Single Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14550)
*Penghao Rao,Tieyong Zeng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种边缘导向的注意力机制，通过适配调制地强化结构特征和抑制伪纹理，在轻量级殊差设计中实现了更好的感知超分辨率效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单图超分辨率任务中的结构信息恢复模糊问题，充分利用边缘优先知识来提升感知质量和结构保真度。

Method: 边缘导向注意力机制，通过联合编码边缘特征咄中间特征激活生成适配调制地图，对响应进行归一化和重新权重，选择性放大结构显著区域。结合轻量殊差设计和多项损失函数训练。

Result: 在标准SISR测试集上表现超过SRGAN、ESRGAN等现有方法，在相似模型复杂度下实现了更好的结构锐利度和感知质量。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种参数高效的边缘优先知识注入方式，通过结构条件化调制机制有效提升了感知超分辨率的性能。

Abstract: Single-image super-resolution (SISR) remains highly ill-posed because
recovering structurally faithful high-frequency content from a single
low-resolution observation is ambiguous. Existing edge-aware methods often
attach edge priors or attention branches onto increasingly complex backbones,
yet ad hoc fusion frequently introduces redundancy, unstable optimization, or
limited structural gains. We address this gap with an edge-guided attention
mechanism that derives an adaptive modulation map from jointly encoded edge
features and intermediate feature activations, then applies it to normalize and
reweight responses, selectively amplifying structurally salient regions while
suppressing spurious textures. In parallel, we integrate this mechanism into a
lightweight residual design trained under a composite objective combining
pixel-wise, perceptual, and adversarial terms to balance fidelity, perceptual
realism, and training stability. Extensive experiments on standard SISR
benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in structural sharpness and
perceptual quality over SRGAN, ESRGAN, and prior edge-attention baselines at
comparable model complexity. The proposed formulation provides (i) a
parameter-efficient path to inject edge priors, (ii) stabilized adversarial
refinement through a tailored multiterm loss, and (iii) enhanced edge fidelity
without resorting to deeper or heavily overparameterized architectures. These
results highlight the effectiveness of principled edge-conditioned modulation
for advancing perceptual super-resolution.

### [5] [Adaptive and Iterative Point Cloud Denoising with Score-Based Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14560)
*Zhaonan Wang,Manyi Li,ShiQing Xin,Changhe Tu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 基于评分液体模型的适应性迭代点云去噪方法，通过噪声估计和适应性调度策略，在保持形状边界和细节的同时获得清洁平滑的去噪结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的点云去噪方法多次迭代去噪过程没有明确的效率安排策略，无法适应不同水平或模式的噪声。

Method: 使用评分液体模型，首先估计噪声变异度并确定适应性去噪调度，然后迭代调用训练好的网络更新点云位置。设计了网络架构和两阶段采样策略来支持特征融合和梯度融合。

Result: 在合成数据集和真实扫描数据集上都获得了更优的去噪结果，既在质量上也在数量上超过了现有最优方法。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效地处理不同模式的噪声，产生清洁平滑且保持形状细节的去噪点云，为点云去噪领域提供了一种适应性较强的解决方案。

Abstract: Point cloud denoising task aims to recover the clean point cloud from the
scanned data coupled with different levels or patterns of noise. The recent
state-of-the-art methods often train deep neural networks to update the point
locations towards the clean point cloud, and empirically repeat the denoising
process several times in order to obtain the denoised results. It is not clear
how to efficiently arrange the iterative denoising processes to deal with
different levels or patterns of noise. In this paper, we propose an adaptive
and iterative point cloud denoising method based on the score-based diffusion
model. For a given noisy point cloud, we first estimate the noise variation and
determine an adaptive denoising schedule with appropriate step sizes, then
invoke the trained network iteratively to update point clouds following the
adaptive schedule. To facilitate this adaptive and iterative denoising process,
we design the network architecture and a two-stage sampling strategy for the
network training to enable feature fusion and gradient fusion for iterative
denoising. Compared to the state-of-the-art point cloud denoising methods, our
approach obtains clean and smooth denoised point clouds, while preserving the
shape boundary and details better. Our results not only outperform the other
methods both qualitatively and quantitatively, but also are preferable on the
synthetic dataset with different patterns of noises, as well as the
real-scanned dataset.

### [6] [DiffVL: Diffusion-Based Visual Localization on 2D Maps via BEV-Conditioned GPS Denoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14565)
*Li Gao,Hongyang Sun,Liu Liu,Yunhao Li,Yang Cai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiffVL是一个基于扩散模型的视觉定位框架，将视觉定位重新定义为GPS去噪任务，通过联合建模GPS、标准地图和视觉信号，实现亚米级精度而无需依赖高精地图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉定位方法面临困境：高精地图精度高但成本昂贵难以扩展，而基于标准地图的方法主要关注鸟瞰图匹配，忽略了普遍存在但噪声严重的GPS信号。

Method: 提出DiffVL框架，利用扩散模型将噪声GPS轨迹与视觉BEV特征和标准地图结合，通过迭代扩散细化恢复真实位姿分布，学习逆转GPS噪声扰动。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，该方法相比BEV匹配基线达到了最先进的精度，实现了亚米级定位精度。

Conclusion: 这项工作证明了扩散模型可以通过将噪声GPS作为生成先验来实现可扩展的定位，实现了从传统基于匹配方法到生成式方法的范式转变。

Abstract: Accurate visual localization is crucial for autonomous driving, yet existing
methods face a fundamental dilemma: While high-definition (HD) maps provide
high-precision localization references, their costly construction and
maintenance hinder scalability, which drives research toward
standard-definition (SD) maps like OpenStreetMap. Current SD-map-based
approaches primarily focus on Bird's-Eye View (BEV) matching between images and
maps, overlooking a ubiquitous signal-noisy GPS. Although GPS is readily
available, it suffers from multipath errors in urban environments. We propose
DiffVL, the first framework to reformulate visual localization as a GPS
denoising task using diffusion models. Our key insight is that noisy GPS
trajectory, when conditioned on visual BEV features and SD maps, implicitly
encode the true pose distribution, which can be recovered through iterative
diffusion refinement. DiffVL, unlike prior BEV-matching methods (e.g.,
OrienterNet) or transformer-based registration approaches, learns to reverse
GPS noise perturbations by jointly modeling GPS, SD map, and visual signals,
achieving sub-meter accuracy without relying on HD maps. Experiments on
multiple datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
accuracy compared to BEV-matching baselines. Crucially, our work proves that
diffusion models can enable scalable localization by treating noisy GPS as a
generative prior-making a paradigm shift from traditional matching-based
methods.

### [7] [DICE: Diffusion Consensus Equilibrium for Sparse-view CT Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14566)
*Leon Suarez-Rodriguez,Roman Jacome,Romario Gualdron-Hurtado,Ana Mantilla-Dulcey,Henry Arguello*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DICE框架通过整合扩散模型和共识平衡方法，在稀疏视图CT重建中显著优于现有方法，在15、30、60视图设置下都能重建高质量图像


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏视图CT重建由于欠采样导致病态逆问题，传统迭代方法难以捕捉医学图像中的复杂结构，而扩散模型作为强大的生成先验能够准确建模复杂图像分布

Method: 提出Diffusion Consensus Equilibrium (DICE)框架，将双代理共识平衡整合到扩散模型采样过程中，交替使用数据一致性代理（通过近端算子强制测量一致性）和先验代理（扩散模型在每个采样步骤执行干净图像估计）

Result: 实验结果表明DICE在均匀和非均匀稀疏视图设置下（15、30、60视图/总共180视图）显著优于最先进的基线方法

Conclusion: DICE通过平衡两个互补代理的迭代过程，有效结合了强大的生成先验能力和测量一致性，证明了其有效性和鲁棒性

Abstract: Sparse-view computed tomography (CT) reconstruction is fundamentally
challenging due to undersampling, leading to an ill-posed inverse problem.
Traditional iterative methods incorporate handcrafted or learned priors to
regularize the solution but struggle to capture the complex structures present
in medical images. In contrast, diffusion models (DMs) have recently emerged as
powerful generative priors that can accurately model complex image
distributions. In this work, we introduce Diffusion Consensus Equilibrium
(DICE), a framework that integrates a two-agent consensus equilibrium into the
sampling process of a DM. DICE alternates between: (i) a data-consistency
agent, implemented through a proximal operator enforcing measurement
consistency, and (ii) a prior agent, realized by a DM performing a clean image
estimation at each sampling step. By balancing these two complementary agents
iteratively, DICE effectively combines strong generative prior capabilities
with measurement consistency. Experimental results show that DICE significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in reconstructing high-quality CT images
under uniform and non-uniform sparse-view settings of 15, 30, and 60 views (out
of a total of 180), demonstrating both its effectiveness and robustness.

### [8] [Domain Adaptation for Ulcerative Colitis Severity Estimation Using Patient-Level Diagnoses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14573)
*Takamasa Yamaguchi,Brian Kenji Iwana,Ryoma Bise,Shota Harada,Takumi Okuo,Kiyohito Tanaka,Kaito Shiku*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种新的弱监督域适配方法，利用患者级诊断结果作为弱监督来改善精细肠炎严重程度估计的域适配性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 精细肠炎严重程度估计方法遇到因医院间工具和临床设置差异导致的域偏移问题，而现有域适配方法在目标域缺乏监督或注释成本高的情况下表现不佳。

Method: 提出使用共享聚合标志和最大严重程度三元组损失的方法，利用患者级诊断是由每个患者内最严重区域决定的特性，实现跨域的类别分布对齐。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在域偏移环境下在UC严重程度估计任务中超过了其他域适配方法的性能。

Conclusion: 通过利用临床常规记录的患者级诊断结果作为弱监督，该方法有效解决了域适配中目标域监督信息缺乏或注释成本高的挑战。

Abstract: The development of methods to estimate the severity of Ulcerative Colitis
(UC) is of significant importance. However, these methods often suffer from
domain shifts caused by differences in imaging devices and clinical settings
across hospitals. Although several domain adaptation methods have been proposed
to address domain shift, they still struggle with the lack of supervision in
the target domain or the high cost of annotation. To overcome these challenges,
we propose a novel Weakly Supervised Domain Adaptation method that leverages
patient-level diagnostic results, which are routinely recorded in UC diagnosis,
as weak supervision in the target domain. The proposed method aligns class-wise
distributions across domains using Shared Aggregation Tokens and a Max-Severity
Triplet Loss, which leverages the characteristic that patient-level diagnoses
are determined by the most severe region within each patient. Experimental
results demonstrate that our method outperforms comparative DA approaches,
improving UC severity estimation in a domain-shifted setting.

### [9] [Do Vision-Language Models See Urban Scenes as People Do? An Urban Perception Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14574)
*Rashid Mushkani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这是一个基于蒙特利尔街景的视觉-语言模型测试基准，通过12名参与者的230份标注评估七个VLM模型在城市感知任务上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过研究人们如何阅读城市场景来指导设计和规划，并建立一个可重现的评估框架来测试视觉-语言模型在参与式城市分析中的性能。

Method: 使用100张蒙特利尔街道图片（真实照片和合成场景各半），7个社区组织的12名参与者提供了30个维度的230份标注。在零样本设置下评估4个视觉-语言模型，使用结构化提示和确定性解析器。

Result: 模型在可见、客观属性上表现更好，而在主观评估上较差。最佳系统（claude-sonnet）在多标签项目上得到宏平均0.31和平均Jaccard 0.48。人类一致性越高的地方，模型分数越高。合成图像略微降低了分数。

Conclusion: 该研究为参与式城市分析提供了一个可重现、包含不确定性评估的基准测试，并发现视觉-语言模型在客观城市属性识别方面表现更好，而在主观感知方面仍有提升空间。

Abstract: Understanding how people read city scenes can inform design and planning. We
introduce a small benchmark for testing vision-language models (VLMs) on urban
perception using 100 Montreal street images, evenly split between photographs
and photorealistic synthetic scenes. Twelve participants from seven community
groups supplied 230 annotation forms across 30 dimensions mixing physical
attributes and subjective impressions. French responses were normalized to
English. We evaluated seven VLMs in a zero-shot setup with a structured prompt
and deterministic parser. We use accuracy for single-choice items and Jaccard
overlap for multi-label items; human agreement uses Krippendorff's alpha and
pairwise Jaccard. Results suggest stronger model alignment on visible,
objective properties than subjective appraisals. The top system (claude-sonnet)
reaches macro 0.31 and mean Jaccard 0.48 on multi-label items. Higher human
agreement coincides with better model scores. Synthetic images slightly lower
scores. We release the benchmark, prompts, and harness for reproducible,
uncertainty-aware evaluation in participatory urban analysis.

### [10] [Feature-aligned Motion Transformation for Efficient Dynamic Point Cloud Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14591)
*Xuan Deng,Xiandong Meng,Longguang Wang,Tiange Zhang,Xiaopeng Fan,Debin Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种特征对齐运动变换(FMT)框架，用于动态点云压缩，通过隐式模型时间变化来替代传统的显式运动估计，并实现了更高的压缩效率和处理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态点云在氛围实际、机器人学等领域应用广泛，但其不规则结构和局部变化使得运动估计和补偿极其困难。现有方法依赖显式运动估计，无法充分抓取精细动态和利用时间相关性。

Method: 提出FMT框架，用特征对齐空间时间对齐策略替代显式运动向量，隐式模型连续时间变化，并在潜在空间中使用对齐特征作为时间上下文。设计了随机访问(RA)参考策略，支持双向运动引用和层化编码。

Result: 在编码和解码效率上超越D-DPCC和AdaDPCC方法，实现了相应的BD-Rate降低（分别为20%和9.4%）。

Conclusion: FMT框架能够合理地同时提高压缩效率和处理性能，为动态点云压缩提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Dynamic point clouds are widely used in applications such as immersive
reality, robotics, and autonomous driving. Efficient compression largely
depends on accurate motion estimation and compensation, yet the irregular
structure and significant local variations of point clouds make this task
highly challenging. Current methods often rely on explicit motion estimation,
whose encoded vectors struggle to capture intricate dynamics and fail to fully
exploit temporal correlations. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a
Feature-aligned Motion Transformation (FMT) framework for dynamic point cloud
compression. FMT replaces explicit motion vectors with a spatiotemporal
alignment strategy that implicitly models continuous temporal variations, using
aligned features as temporal context within a latent-space conditional encoding
framework. Furthermore, we design a random access (RA) reference strategy that
enables bidirectional motion referencing and layered encoding, thereby
supporting frame-level parallel compression. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method surpasses D-DPCC and AdaDPCC in both encoding and decoding
efficiency, while also achieving BD-Rate reductions of 20% and 9.4%,
respectively. These results highlight the effectiveness of FMT in jointly
improving compression efficiency and processing performance.

### [11] [HybridMamba: A Dual-domain Mamba for 3D Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14609)
*Weitong Wu,Zhaohu Xing,Jing Gong,Qin Peng,Lei Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HybridMamba是一种用于3D医学图像分割的新架构，通过双互补机制结合全局和局部特征，在MRI和CT数据集上显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mamba在3D生物医学图像分割中表现出色，能够解决CNN长距离依赖建模的局限性并减少Transformer的计算开销，但过度关注全局上下文可能会损害关键的局部结构信息，导致分割结果边界模糊和区域失真。

Method: 提出HybridMamba架构，采用双互补机制：1）特征扫描策略，通过轴向遍历和局部自适应路径逐步整合表示，协调局部和全局表示的关系；2）结合空间-频率分析的门控模块，实现全面的上下文建模。

Result: 在MRI和CT数据集上的实验表明，HybridMamba在3D医学图像分割方面显著优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: HybridMamba通过有效平衡全局和局部特征表示，解决了现有方法的局限性，在3D医学图像分割任务中取得了优异性能。

Abstract: In the domain of 3D biomedical image segmentation, Mamba exhibits the
superior performance for it addresses the limitations in modeling long-range
dependencies inherent to CNNs and mitigates the abundant computational overhead
associated with Transformer-based frameworks when processing high-resolution
medical volumes. However, attaching undue importance to global context modeling
may inadvertently compromise critical local structural information, thus
leading to boundary ambiguity and regional distortion in segmentation outputs.
Therefore, we propose the HybridMamba, an architecture employing dual
complementary mechanisms: 1) a feature scanning strategy that progressively
integrates representations both axial-traversal and local-adaptive pathways to
harmonize the relationship between local and global representations, and 2) a
gated module combining spatial-frequency analysis for comprehensive contextual
modeling. Besides, we collect a multi-center CT dataset related to lung cancer.
Experiments on MRI and CT datasets demonstrate that HybridMamba significantly
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in 3D medical image segmentation.

*Yue Cao,Quansong He,Kaishen Wang,Jianlong Xiong,Tao He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出动态跳跃连接(DSC)模块解决U型网络中传统跳跃连接的两个限制：特征间约束和特征内约束，通过测试时训练和动态多尺度核实现自适应特征融合


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统U型网络的跳跃连接存在固定路径传输和缺乏多尺度特征交互的问题，限制了医学图像分割的性能

Method: 提出DSC模块，包含测试时训练(TTT)模块实现动态特征适应，以及动态多尺度核(DMSK)模块根据全局上下文自适应选择核大小

Result: DSC模块具有即插即用特性，在CNN、Transformer、混合CNN-Transformer和Mamba-based等多种U型网络中都表现出有效性

Conclusion: 动态跳跃连接模块通过自适应机制显著提升了跨层连接性，为医学图像分割提供了更灵活有效的特征融合方案

Abstract: U-like networks have become fundamental frameworks in medical image
segmentation through skip connections that bridge high-level semantics and
low-level spatial details. Despite their success, conventional skip connections
exhibit two key limitations: inter-feature constraints and intra-feature
constraints. The inter-feature constraint refers to the static nature of
feature fusion in traditional skip connections, where information is
transmitted along fixed pathways regardless of feature content. The
intra-feature constraint arises from the insufficient modeling of multi-scale
feature interactions, thereby hindering the effective aggregation of global
contextual information. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel
Dynamic Skip Connection (DSC) block that fundamentally enhances cross-layer
connectivity through adaptive mechanisms. The DSC block integrates two
complementary components. (1) Test-Time Training (TTT) module. This module
addresses the inter-feature constraint by enabling dynamic adaptation of hidden
representations during inference, facilitating content-aware feature
refinement. (2) Dynamic Multi-Scale Kernel (DMSK) module. To mitigate the
intra-feature constraint, this module adaptively selects kernel sizes based on
global contextual cues, enhancing the network capacity for multi-scale feature
integration. The DSC block is architecture-agnostic and can be seamlessly
incorporated into existing U-like network structures. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the plug-and-play effectiveness of the proposed DSC block across
CNN-based, Transformer-based, hybrid CNN-Transformer, and Mamba-based U-like
networks.

Motivation: 解决骨架动作识别中的两个长期挑战：标记训练样本稀缺性，以及难以同时建模短程和长程时间依赖关系。

Method: 提出统一框架LSTC-MDA：1）LSTC模块包含并行的短程和长程分支，通过学习的相似性权重进行自适应对齐和融合；2）扩展JMDA数据增广，在输入级别使用加性Mixup，并限制在同一相机视角内操作以避免分布偏移。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上取得最优结果：NTU 60（X-Sub 94.1%，X-View 97.5%）、NTU 120（X-Sub 90.4%，X-Set 92.0%）、NW-UCLA（97.2%）。消融实验验证各组件有效性。

Conclusion: LSTC-MDA通过改进时间建模和数据多样性，有效解决了骨架动作识别的关键挑战，为相关研究提供了新的技术路径。

Abstract: Skeleton-based action recognition faces two longstanding challenges: the
scarcity of labeled training samples and difficulty modeling short- and
long-range temporal dependencies. To address these issues, we propose a unified
framework, LSTC-MDA, which simultaneously improves temporal modeling and data
diversity. We introduce a novel Long-Short Term Temporal Convolution (LSTC)
module with parallel short- and long-term branches, these two feature branches
are then aligned and fused adaptively using learned similarity weights to
preserve critical long-range cues lost by conventional stride-2 temporal
convolutions. We also extend Joint Mixing Data Augmentation (JMDA) with an
Additive Mixup at the input level, diversifying training samples and
restricting mixup operations to the same camera view to avoid distribution
shifts. Ablation studies confirm each component contributes. LSTC-MDA achieves
state-of-the-art results: 94.1% and 97.5% on NTU 60 (X-Sub and X-View), 90.4%
and 92.0% on NTU 120 (X-Sub and X-Set),97.2% on NW-UCLA. Code:

Method: 采用新颖的数据集构建流水线，利用两个多模态大语言模型分别生成视觉自适应编辑指令和生成高保真编辑图像，构建包含18种非风格转换编辑类型和38种风格转换操作的综合数据集。

Result: 实验表明，使用MultiEdit-Train集微调基础开源模型，在提出的MultiEdit-Test基准测试中显著提升了模型在复杂编辑任务上的性能，同时有效保持了在标准编辑基准上的能力。

Conclusion: MultiEdit为推进更多样化和具有挑战性的指令图像编辑能力研究提供了宝贵资源，数据集已在HuggingFace上公开可用。

Abstract: Current instruction-based image editing (IBIE) methods struggle with
challenging editing tasks, as both editing types and sample counts of existing
datasets are limited. Moreover, traditional dataset construction often contains
noisy image-caption pairs, which may introduce biases and limit model
capabilities in complex editing scenarios. To address these limitations, we
introduce MultiEdit, a comprehensive dataset featuring over 107K high-quality
image editing samples. It encompasses 6 challenging editing tasks through a
diverse collection of 18 non-style-transfer editing types and 38 style transfer
operations, covering a spectrum from sophisticated style transfer to complex
semantic operations like person reference editing and in-image text editing. We
employ a novel dataset construction pipeline that utilizes two multi-modal
large language models (MLLMs) to generate visual-adaptive editing instructions
and produce high-fidelity edited images, respectively. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that fine-tuning foundational open-source models with our
MultiEdit-Train set substantially improves models' performance on sophisticated
editing tasks in our proposed MultiEdit-Test benchmark, while effectively
preserving their capabilities on the standard editing benchmark. We believe
MultiEdit provides a valuable resource for advancing research into more diverse
and challenging IBIE capabilities. Our dataset is available at

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的视觉基础模型可解释性方法，通过Attention Lattice Adapter和Alternating Epoch Architect机制，在保持模型性能的同时提升了解释质量和适配性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有可解释性方法在复杂模型上适配性不足的问题，无需手动选择层次且能部分更新模型参数来提升可解释性。

Method: 提出了两个新机制：Attention Lattice Adapter (ALA)自动化层选择过程，Alternating Epoch Architect (AEA)隔代更新参数解决关注区域过小问题。

Result: 在CUB-200-2011和ImageNet-S数据集上，方法在mean IoU、插入分、删除分和插入-删除分都超过基线方法。CUB-200-2011数据集上mean IoU提升53.2个百分点。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了视觉基础模型的可解释性，具有良好的适配性和解释质量，为复杂模型的可解释性研究提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: In this study, we consider the problem of generating visual explanations in
visual foundation models. Numerous methods have been proposed for this purpose;
however, they often cannot be applied to complex models due to their lack of
adaptability. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel explanation
generation method in visual foundation models that is aimed at both generating
explanations and partially updating model parameters to enhance
interpretability. Our approach introduces two novel mechanisms: Attention
Lattice Adapter (ALA) and Alternating Epoch Architect (AEA). ALA mechanism
simplifies the process by eliminating the need for manual layer selection, thus
enhancing the model's adaptability and interpretability. Moreover, the AEA
mechanism, which updates ALA's parameters every other epoch, effectively
addresses the common issue of overly small attention regions. We evaluated our
method on two benchmark datasets, CUB-200-2011 and ImageNet-S. Our results
showed that our method outperformed the baseline methods in terms of mean
intersection over union (IoU), insertion score, deletion score, and
insertion-deletion score on both the CUB-200-2011 and ImageNet-S datasets.
Notably, our best model achieved a 53.2-point improvement in mean IoU on the
CUB-200-2011 dataset compared with the baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DACoN是一个利用基础模型进行线条动画自动上色的框架，通过融合基础模型的语义特征和CNN的空间特征，支持任意数量的参考图像，解决了遮挡、姿态变化和视角变化等挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的深度学习方法在动画线条自动上色中面临遮挡、姿态变化和视角变化的困难，且通常只能支持1-2张参考图像，限制了上色效果。

Method: 提出DACoN框架，利用基础模型提取部件级语义特征（即使在线条图中），并将其与CNN提取的高分辨率空间特征融合，实现细粒度且鲁棒的特征提取，同时移除了对参考图像数量的限制。

Result: 定量和定性评估表明，使用多个参考图像能带来显著优势，实现了优越的上色性能。

Conclusion: DACoN通过基础模型和特征融合技术，有效解决了动画线条上色中的关键挑战，支持任意数量参考图像，显著提升了上色质量。

Abstract: Automatic colorization of line drawings has been widely studied to reduce the
labor cost of hand-drawn anime production. Deep learning approaches, including
image/video generation and feature-based correspondence, have improved accuracy
but struggle with occlusions, pose variations, and viewpoint changes. To
address these challenges, we propose DACoN, a framework that leverages
foundation models to capture part-level semantics, even in line drawings. Our
method fuses low-resolution semantic features from foundation models with
high-resolution spatial features from CNNs for fine-grained yet robust feature
extraction. In contrast to previous methods that rely on the Multiplex
Transformer and support only one or two reference images, DACoN removes this
constraint, allowing any number of references. Quantitative and qualitative
evaluations demonstrate the benefits of using multiple reference images,
achieving superior colorization performance. Our code and model are available
at https://github.com/kzmngt/DACoN.

Conclusion: 该方法通过增强表示和协调信息蒸馏，显著推进了3D单目人体化身重建技术，实现了新颖视角和姿态下时空一致的渲染

Abstract: Reconstructing high-fidelity animatable human avatars from monocular videos
remains challenging due to insufficient geometric information in single-view
observations. While recent 3D Gaussian Splatting methods have shown promise,
they struggle with surface detail preservation due to the free-form nature of
3D Gaussian primitives. To address both the representation limitations and
information scarcity, we propose a novel method, \textbf{FMGS-Avatar}, that
integrates two key innovations. First, we introduce Mesh-Guided 2D Gaussian
Splatting, where 2D Gaussian primitives are attached directly to template mesh
faces with constrained position, rotation, and movement, enabling superior
surface alignment and geometric detail preservation. Second, we leverage
foundation models trained on large-scale datasets, such as Sapiens, to
complement the limited visual cues from monocular videos. However, when
distilling multi-modal prior knowledge from foundation models, conflicting
optimization objectives can emerge as different modalities exhibit distinct
parameter sensitivities. We address this through a coordinated training
strategy with selective gradient isolation, enabling each loss component to
optimize its relevant parameters without interference. Through this combination
of enhanced representation and coordinated information distillation, our
approach significantly advances 3D monocular human avatar reconstruction.
Experimental evaluation demonstrates superior reconstruction quality compared
to existing methods, with notable gains in geometric accuracy and appearance
fidelity while providing rich semantic information. Additionally, the distilled
prior knowledge within a shared canonical space naturally enables spatially and
temporally consistent rendering under novel views and poses.

Conclusion: 通过让MLLM直接参与重排序过程并支持全局比较、一致推理和可解释决策，显著提升了图像检索的准确性和性能

Abstract: Image retrieval remains a fundamental yet challenging problem in computer
vision. While recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have
demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities, existing methods typically employ
them only for evaluation, without involving them directly in the ranking
process. As a result, their rich multimodal reasoning abilities remain
underutilized, leading to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose a
novel Chain-of-Thought Re-Ranking (CoTRR) method to address this issue.
Specifically, we design a listwise ranking prompt that enables MLLM to directly
participate in re-ranking candidate images. This ranking process is grounded in
an image evaluation prompt, which assesses how well each candidate aligns with
users query. By allowing MLLM to perform listwise reasoning, our method
supports global comparison, consistent reasoning, and interpretable
decision-making - all of which are essential for accurate image retrieval. To
enable structured and fine-grained analysis, we further introduce a query
deconstruction prompt, which breaks down the original query into multiple
semantic components. Extensive experiments on five datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our CoTRR method, which achieves state-of-the-art performance
across three image retrieval tasks, including text-to-image retrieval (TIR),
composed image retrieval (CIR) and chat-based image retrieval (Chat-IR). Our
code is available at https://github.com/freshfish15/CoTRR .

Abstract: Finding smell references in historic artworks is a challenging problem.
Beyond artwork-specific challenges such as stylistic variations, their
recognition demands exceptionally detailed annotation classes, resulting in
annotation sparsity and extreme class imbalance. In this work, we explore the
potential of synthetic data generation to alleviate these issues and enable
accurate detection of smell-related objects. We evaluate several
diffusion-based augmentation strategies and demonstrate that incorporating
synthetic data into model training can improve detection performance. Our
findings suggest that leveraging the large-scale pretraining of diffusion
models offers a promising approach for improving detection accuracy,
particularly in niche applications where annotations are scarce and costly to
obtain. Furthermore, the proposed approach proves to be effective even with
relatively small amounts of data, and scaling it up provides high potential for
further enhancements.

Abstract: Comparing vision language models on videos is particularly complex, as the
performances is jointly determined by the model's visual representation
capacity and the frame-sampling strategy used to construct the input. Current
video benchmarks are suspected to suffer from substantial frame-sampling bias,
as models are evaluated with different frame selection strategies. In this
work, we propose the first frame-accurate benchmark of state-of-the-art small
VLMs for video question-answering, evaluated under controlled frame-sampling
strategies. Our results confirm the suspected bias and highlight both
data-specific and task-specific behaviors of SVLMs under different
frame-sampling techniques. By open-sourcing our benchmarking code, we provide
the community with a reproducible and unbiased protocol for evaluating video
VLMs and emphasize the need for standardized frame-sampling strategies tailored
to each benchmarking dataset in future research.

Motivation: 解决现有参数化点云表示方法中的两难问题：高适配性模型（如样条曲面）计算成本高，而实时方法（如高斯混合模型或平面）粒子度低、准确性差

Method: 首先使用高斯混合模型将点云分割成多个集群，然后选择平坦集群合并为平面或曲面。平面采用2D音符基边界描述方法进行拟合和边界定义，曲面则用B样条曲面拟合并使用同样的边界描述方法

Result: 在多个公开数据集上评估，该方法比现有最先进方法更稳健，效率提升3.78倍，准确性比高斯混合模型提高2倍，在低功耗弄机电脑上运行速度达36.4fps

Conclusion: 该多模型参数化表示方法有效解决了高效实时性与高准确性之间的矛盾，为内存效率优化地图构建和多机器人协作等任务提供了高性能的点云表示方案

Abstract: In recent years, parametric representations of point clouds have been widely
applied in tasks such as memory-efficient mapping and multi-robot
collaboration. Highly adaptive models, like spline surfaces or quadrics, are
computationally expensive in detection or fitting. In contrast, real-time
methods, such as Gaussian mixture models or planes, have low degrees of
freedom, making high accuracy with few primitives difficult. To tackle this
problem, a multi-model parametric representation with real-time surface
detection and fitting is proposed. Specifically, the Gaussian mixture model is
first employed to segment the point cloud into multiple clusters. Then, flat
clusters are selected and merged into planes or curved surfaces. Planes can be
easily fitted and delimited by a 2D voxel-based boundary description method.
Surfaces with curvature are fitted by B-spline surfaces and the same boundary
description method is employed. Through evaluations on multiple public
datasets, the proposed surface detection exhibits greater robustness than the
state-of-the-art approach, with 3.78 times improvement in efficiency.
Meanwhile, this representation achieves a 2-fold gain in accuracy over Gaussian
mixture models, operating at 36.4 fps on a low-power onboard computer.

Motivation: 解决当前基于GAN反转的数据蒸馏方法对预训练SR网络和类别特定信息的依赖，提高方法的通用性和适用性。

Method: 首先提取高梯度补丁并使用CLIP特征对图像分类，然后微调扩散模型学习补丁分布并合成蒸馏训练图像。

Result: 仅使用0.68%原始数据集训练SR Transformer模型，性能下降仅0.3 dB；扩散模型微调4小时，SR模型训练1小时，远少于完整数据集训练所需的11小时。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了最先进的性能，显著减少了训练数据需求和计算时间，具有更好的通用性。

Abstract: Training deep neural networks has become increasingly demanding, requiring
large datasets and significant computational resources, especially as model
complexity advances. Data distillation methods, which aim to improve data
efficiency, have emerged as promising solutions to this challenge. In the field
of single image super-resolution (SISR), the reliance on large training
datasets highlights the importance of these techniques. Recently, a generative
adversarial network (GAN) inversion-based data distillation framework for SR
was proposed, showing potential for better data utilization. However, the
current method depends heavily on pre-trained SR networks and class-specific
information, limiting its generalizability and applicability. To address these
issues, we introduce a new data distillation approach for image SR that does
not need class labels or pre-trained SR models. In particular, we first extract
high-gradient patches and categorize images based on CLIP features, then
fine-tune a diffusion model on the selected patches to learn their distribution
and synthesize distilled training images. Experimental results show that our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance while using significantly less
training data and requiring less computational time. Specifically, when we
train a baseline Transformer model for SR with only 0.68\% of the original
dataset, the performance drop is just 0.3 dB. In this case, diffusion model
fine-tuning takes 4 hours, and SR model training completes within 1 hour, much
shorter than the 11-hour training time with the full dataset.

Abstract: Text to image latent diffusion models have recently advanced medical image
synthesis, but applications to 3D CT generation remain limited. Existing
approaches rely on simplified prompts, neglecting the rich semantic detail in
full radiology reports, which reduces text image alignment and clinical
fidelity. We propose Report2CT, a radiology report conditional latent diffusion
framework for synthesizing 3D chest CT volumes directly from free text
radiology reports, incorporating both findings and impression sections using
multiple text encoder. Report2CT integrates three pretrained medical text
encoders (BiomedVLP CXR BERT, MedEmbed, and ClinicalBERT) to capture nuanced
clinical context. Radiology reports and voxel spacing information condition a
3D latent diffusion model trained on 20000 CT volumes from the CT RATE dataset.
Model performance was evaluated using Frechet Inception Distance (FID) for real
synthetic distributional similarity and CLIP based metrics for semantic
alignment, with additional qualitative and quantitative comparisons against
GenerateCT model. Report2CT generated anatomically consistent CT volumes with
excellent visual quality and text image alignment. Multi encoder conditioning
improved CLIP scores, indicating stronger preservation of fine grained clinical
details in the free text radiology reports. Classifier free guidance further
enhanced alignment with only a minor trade off in FID. We ranked first in the
VLM3D Challenge at MICCAI 2025 on Text Conditional CT Generation and achieved
state of the art performance across all evaluation metrics. By leveraging
complete radiology reports and multi encoder text conditioning, Report2CT
advances 3D CT synthesis, producing clinically faithful and high quality
synthetic data.

Conclusion: 该算法为结合领域知识和深度神经网络提供了新的思路，在骨折骨分割方面表现出优越性能，具有重要的临床应用价值。

Abstract: For bone segmentation, the classical geodesic active contour model is usually
limited by its indiscriminate feature extraction, and then struggles to handle
the phenomena of edge obstruction, edge leakage and bone fracture. Thus, we
propose a fracture interactive geodesic active contour algorithm tailored for
bone segmentation, which can better capture bone features and perform robustly
to the presence of bone fractures and soft tissues. Inspired by orthopedic
knowledge, we construct a novel edge-detector function that combines the
intensity and gradient norm, which guides the contour towards bone edges
without being obstructed by other soft tissues and therefore reduces
mis-segmentation. Furthermore, distance information, where fracture prompts can
be embedded, is introduced into the contour evolution as an adaptive step size
to stabilize the evolution and help the contour stop at bone edges and
fractures. This embedding provides a way to interact with bone fractures and
improves the accuracy in the fracture regions. Experiments in pelvic and ankle
segmentation demonstrate the effectiveness on addressing the aforementioned
problems and show an accurate, stable and consistent performance, indicating a
broader application in other bone anatomies. Our algorithm also provides
insights into combining the domain knowledge and deep neural networks.

Conclusion: MED损失函数能有效改善皮层表面重建的变形质量，为学习型重建方法提供了更好的正则化方案

Abstract: Cortical surface reconstruction (CSR) from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
is fundamental to neuroimage analysis, enabling morphological studies of the
cerebral cortex and functional brain mapping. Recent advances in learning-based
CSR have dramatically accelerated processing, allowing for reconstructions
through the deformation of anatomical templates within seconds. However,
ensuring the learned deformations are optimal in terms of deformation energy
and consistent across training runs remains a particular challenge. In this
work, we design a Minimal Energy Deformation (MED) loss, acting as a
regularizer on the deformation trajectories and complementing the widely used
Chamfer distance in CSR. We incorporate it into the recent V2C-Flow model and
demonstrate considerable improvements in previously neglected training
consistency and reproducibility without harming reconstruction accuracy and
topological correctness.

Conclusion: ProtoMedX在保持高精度的同时提供了临床医生可理解的可视化解释，满足医疗AI的可信性要求

Abstract: Bone health studies are crucial in medical practice for the early detection
and treatment of Osteopenia and Osteoporosis. Clinicians usually make a
diagnosis based on densitometry (DEXA scans) and patient history. The
applications of AI in this field are ongoing research. Most successful methods
rely on deep learning models that use vision alone (DEXA/X-ray imagery) and
focus on prediction accuracy, while explainability is often disregarded and
left to post hoc assessments of input contributions. We propose ProtoMedX, a
multi-modal model that uses both DEXA scans of the lumbar spine and patient
records. ProtoMedX's prototype-based architecture is explainable by design,
which is crucial for medical applications, especially in the context of the
upcoming EU AI Act, as it allows explicit analysis of model decisions,
including incorrect ones. ProtoMedX demonstrates state-of-the-art performance
in bone health classification while also providing explanations that can be
visually understood by clinicians. Using a dataset of 4,160 real NHS patients,
the proposed ProtoMedX achieves 87.58% accuracy in vision-only tasks and 89.8%
in its multi-modal variant, both surpassing existing published methods.

Abstract: To maintain an overview of urban conditions, city administrations manage
databases of objects like traffic signs and trees, complete with their
geocoordinates. Incidents such as graffiti or road damage are also relevant. As
digitization increases, so does the need for more data and up-to-date
databases, requiring significant manual effort. This paper introduces
MapAnything, a module that automatically determines the geocoordinates of
objects using individual images. Utilizing advanced Metric Depth Estimation
models, MapAnything calculates geocoordinates based on the object's distance
from the camera, geometric principles, and camera specifications. We detail and
validate the module, providing recommendations for automating urban object and
incident mapping. Our evaluation measures the accuracy of estimated distances
against LiDAR point clouds in urban environments, analyzing performance across
distance intervals and semantic areas like roads and vegetation. The module's
effectiveness is demonstrated through practical use cases involving traffic

Result: 在5个传统基准测试和数据集上（包括合成和真实场景），该框架相比之前的正则化方法表现出更优越的性能。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了模型主要过拟合噪声的问题，并提出了有效的解决方案，为提升图像超分辨率模型的泛化能力提供了新思路。

Abstract: Generalizable Image Super-Resolution aims to enhance model generalization
capabilities under unknown degradations. To achieve this goal, the models are
expected to focus only on image content-related features instead of overfitting
degradations. Recently, numerous approaches such as Dropout and Feature
Alignment have been proposed to suppress models' natural tendency to overfit
degradations and yield promising results. Nevertheless, these works have
assumed that models overfit to all degradation types (e.g., blur, noise, JPEG),
while through careful investigations in this paper, we discover that models
predominantly overfit to noise, largely attributable to its distinct
degradation pattern compared to other degradation types. In this paper, we
propose a targeted feature denoising framework, comprising noise detection and
denoising modules. Our approach presents a general solution that can be
seamlessly integrated with existing super-resolution models without requiring
architectural modifications. Our framework demonstrates superior performance
compared to previous regularization-based methods across five traditional
benchmarks and datasets, encompassing both synthetic and real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: 本文重现了Faithful Vision Transformers (FViTs)的结果，验证了雷过散去噪平滑(DDS)技术在视觉Transformer可解释性稳健性方面的效果，并扩展研究了计算成本和环境影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证arXiv:2311.17983所提出的FViTs方法的结果，特别是重点考察DDS技术是否真的能够提高视觉Transformer在分割任务和分类任务中的可解释性稳健性，以及该技术的普适性和成本效益。

Method: 重现FViTs实验，使用雷过散去噪平滑(DDS)技术应用于基线方法和最新的Attribution Rollout方法，测试在攻击条件下的稳健性。同时评估计算成本和环境影响。

Result: 结果大体与原研究结论一致，DDS能够提高视觉Transformer的可解释性稳健性，但发现了一些轻微的差异并进行了讨论。

Conclusion: 雷过散去噪平滑(DDS)技术确实能够提升视觉Transformer模型的可解释性稳健性，但需要考虑其计算成本和环境影响，为后续研究提供了实践指导。

Abstract: This work aims to reproduce the results of Faithful Vision Transformers
(FViTs) proposed by arXiv:2311.17983 alongside interpretability methods for
Vision Transformers from arXiv:2012.09838 and Xu (2022) et al. We investigate
claims made by arXiv:2311.17983, namely that the usage of Diffusion Denoised
Smoothing (DDS) improves interpretability robustness to (1) attacks in a
segmentation task and (2) perturbation and attacks in a classification task. We
also extend the original study by investigating the authors' claims that adding
DDS to any interpretability method can improve its robustness under attack.
This is tested on baseline methods and the recently proposed Attribution
Rollout method. In addition, we measure the computational costs and
environmental impact of obtaining an FViT through DDS. Our results broadly
agree with the original study's findings, although minor discrepancies were
found and discussed.

TL;DR: MARIC是一个多智能体框架，将图像分类重构为协作推理过程，通过多个智能体从不同视角分析图像并综合推理，显著提升了分类性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像分类方法需要大量参数训练和标注数据，而现有视觉语言模型依赖单次表示，难以捕捉视觉内容的互补方面

Method: 使用Outliner Agent分析图像全局主题并生成提示，三个Aspect Agent从不同视觉维度提取细粒度描述，Reasoning Agent通过反思步骤综合这些输出进行统一分类

Result: 在4个不同的图像分类基准数据集上，MARIC显著优于基线方法

Conclusion: 多智能体视觉推理方法能够实现更鲁棒和可解释的图像分类，有效缓解了参数密集型训练和单一VLM推理的局限性

Abstract: Image classification has traditionally relied on parameter-intensive model
training, requiring large-scale annotated datasets and extensive fine tuning to
achieve competitive performance. While recent vision language models (VLMs)
alleviate some of these constraints, they remain limited by their reliance on
single pass representations, often failing to capture complementary aspects of
visual content. In this paper, we introduce Multi Agent based Reasoning for
Image Classification (MARIC), a multi agent framework that reformulates image
classification as a collaborative reasoning process. MARIC first utilizes an
Outliner Agent to analyze the global theme of the image and generate targeted
prompts. Based on these prompts, three Aspect Agents extract fine grained
descriptions along distinct visual dimensions. Finally, a Reasoning Agent
synthesizes these complementary outputs through integrated reflection step,
producing a unified representation for classification. By explicitly
decomposing the task into multiple perspectives and encouraging reflective
synthesis, MARIC mitigates the shortcomings of both parameter-heavy training
and monolithic VLM reasoning. Experiments on 4 diverse image classification
benchmark datasets demonstrate that MARIC significantly outperforms baselines,
highlighting the effectiveness of multi-agent visual reasoning for robust and
interpretable image classification.

Conclusion: 该统一框架通过潜在滿射模型和创新的属性导向模块，实现了高效、高质量的人像匿名化，为个人隐私保护和计算机视觉应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The growing use of portrait images in computer vision highlights the need to
protect personal identities. At the same time, anonymized images must remain
useful for downstream computer vision tasks. In this work, we propose a unified
framework that leverages the inpainting ability of latent diffusion models to
generate realistic anonymized images. Unlike prior approaches, we have complete
control over the anonymization process by designing an adaptive
attribute-guidance module that applies gradient correction during the reverse
denoising process, aligning the facial attributes of the generated image with
those of the synthesized target image. Our framework also supports localized
anonymization, allowing users to specify which facial regions are left
unchanged. Extensive experiments conducted on the public CelebA-HQ and FFHQ
datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches while
requiring no additional model training. The source code is available on our

Method: 使用多任务模型学习肉眼核磁共振成像数据的早期动态表征，将纵向变化形成潜在空间中的轨迹，作为预测基础

Conclusion: 通过学习早期治疗响应动态表征，可以有效预测乳腺癌患者的病理完全罔效响应，为个化治疗提供重要依据

Abstract: Effective therapy decisions require models that predict the individual
response to treatment. This is challenging since the progression of disease and
response to treatment vary substantially across patients. Here, we propose to
learn a representation of the early dynamics of treatment response from imaging
data to predict pathological complete response (pCR) in breast cancer patients
undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT). The longitudinal change in magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) data of the breast forms trajectories in the latent
space, serving as basis for prediction of successful response. The multi-task
model represents appearance, fosters temporal continuity and accounts for the
comparably high heterogeneity in the non-responder cohort.In experiments on the
publicly available ISPY-2 dataset, a linear classifier in the latent trajectory
space achieves a balanced accuracy of 0.761 using only pre-treatment data (T0),
0.811 using early response (T0 + T1), and 0.861 using four imaging time points
(T0 -> T3). The code will be made available upon paper acceptance.

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种有效的可视化方法，能够揭示空间设备位置估计网络的决策基础，为推进数据驱动方法在实际宇宙任务中的应用提供了重要的透明性保障。

Abstract: On-orbit operations require the estimation of the relative 6D pose, i.e.,
position and orientation, between a chaser spacecraft and its target. While
data-driven spacecraft pose estimation methods have been developed, their
adoption in real missions is hampered by the lack of understanding of their
decision process. This paper presents a method to visualize the 3D visual cues
on which a given pose estimator relies. For this purpose, we train a NeRF-based
image generator using the gradients back-propagated through the pose estimation
network. This enforces the generator to render the main 3D features exploited
by the spacecraft pose estimation network. Experiments demonstrate that our
method recovers the relevant 3D cues. Furthermore, they offer additional
insights on the relationship between the pose estimation network supervision
and its implicit representation of the target spacecraft.

Conclusion: 该方法通过伪标签训练和级联多模型推理策略，在长复杂视频分割场景中表现出强大的鲁棒性和准确性

Abstract: Complex Video Object Segmentation (VOS) presents significant challenges in
accurately segmenting objects across frames, especially in the presence of
small and similar targets, frequent occlusions, rapid motion, and complex
interactions. In this report, we present our solution for the LSVOS 2025 VOS
Track based on the SAM2 framework. We adopt a pseudo-labeling strategy during
training: a trained SAM2 checkpoint is deployed within the SAM2Long framework
to generate pseudo labels for the MOSE test set, which are then combined with
existing data for further training. For inference, the SAM2Long framework is
employed to obtain our primary segmentation results, while an open-source SeC
model runs in parallel to produce complementary predictions. A cascaded
decision mechanism dynamically integrates outputs from both models, exploiting
the temporal stability of SAM2Long and the concept-level robustness of SeC.
Benefiting from pseudo-label training and cascaded multi-model inference, our
approach achieves a J\&F score of 0.8616 on the MOSE test set -- +1.4 points
over our SAM2Long baseline -- securing the 2nd place in the LSVOS 2025 VOS
Track, and demonstrating strong robustness and accuracy in long, complex video
segmentation scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究CLIP等基础模型在专门生物识别任务微调后是否会出现过度专业化问题，以及这种专业化对模型原有跨域泛化能力的影响

Method: 系统评估三个针对FR、MAD和PAD任务微调的CLIP实例，在14个通用视觉数据集上进行零样本和线性探测评估，同时测试生物识别基准性能

Result: 微调模型确实出现过度专业化，特别是复杂的人脸识别任务；FRoundation模型在IJB-C基准上提升58.52%，但在ImageNetV2上从69.84%降至51.63%；更大的CLIP架构能更好地保持原始泛化能力

Conclusion: 任务复杂度和分类头设计（多类vs二元）与灾难性遗忘程度相关，增加模型容量有助于缓解过度专业化问题

Abstract: Foundation models such as CLIP have demonstrated exceptional zero- and
few-shot transfer capabilities across diverse vision tasks. However, when
fine-tuned for highly specialized biometric tasks, face recognition (FR),
morphing attack detection (MAD), and presentation attack detection (PAD), these
models may suffer from over-specialization. Thus, they may lose one of their
foundational strengths, cross-domain generalization. In this work, we
systematically quantify these trade-offs by evaluating three instances of CLIP
fine-tuned for FR, MAD, and PAD. We evaluate each adapted model as well as the
original CLIP baseline on 14 general vision datasets under zero-shot and
linear-probe protocols, alongside common FR, MAD, and PAD benchmarks. Our
results indicate that fine-tuned models suffer from over-specialization,
especially when fine-tuned for complex tasks of FR. Also, our results pointed
out that task complexity and classification head design, multi-class (FR) vs.
binary (MAD and PAD), correlate with the degree of catastrophic forgetting. The
FRoundation model with the ViT-L backbone outperforms other approaches on the
large-scale FR benchmark IJB-C, achieving an improvement of up to 58.52%.
However, it experiences a substantial performance drop on ImageNetV2, reaching
only 51.63% compared to 69.84% achieved by the baseline CLIP model. Moreover,
the larger CLIP architecture consistently preserves more of the model's
original generalization ability than the smaller variant, indicating that
increased model capacity may help mitigate over-specialization.

Conclusion: DF-LLaVA框架成功解决了合成图像检测中准确性与可解释性的平衡问题，为图像真实性评估提供了既准确又可解释的解决方案

Abstract: With the increasing prevalence of synthetic images, evaluating image
authenticity and locating forgeries accurately while maintaining human
interpretability remains a challenging task. Existing detection models
primarily focus on simple authenticity classification, ultimately providing
only a forgery probability or binary judgment, which offers limited explanatory
insights into image authenticity. Moreover, while MLLM-based detection methods
can provide more interpretable results, they still lag behind expert models in
terms of pure authenticity classification accuracy. To address this, we propose
DF-LLaVA, a simple yet effective framework that unlocks the intrinsic
discrimination potential of MLLMs. Our approach first extracts latent knowledge
from MLLMs and then injects it into training via prompts. This framework allows
LLaVA to achieve outstanding detection accuracy exceeding expert models while
still maintaining the interpretability offered by MLLMs. Extensive experiments
confirm the superiority of our DF-LLaVA, achieving both high accuracy and
explainability in synthetic image detection. Code is available online at:

Conclusion: CMGR框架通过有效利用CLIP的层次空间语义和几何-纹理分离策略，成功解决了3D类增量学习中的关键挑战

Abstract: The rapid growth of 3D digital content necessitates expandable recognition
systems for open-world scenarios. However, existing 3D class-incremental
learning methods struggle under extreme data scarcity due to geometric
misalignment and texture bias. While recent approaches integrate 3D data with
2D foundation models (e.g., CLIP), they suffer from semantic blurring caused by
texture-biased projections and indiscriminate fusion of geometric-textural
cues, leading to unstable decision prototypes and catastrophic forgetting. To
address these issues, we propose Cross-Modal Geometric Rectification (CMGR), a
framework that enhances 3D geometric fidelity by leveraging CLIP's hierarchical
spatial semantics. Specifically, we introduce a Structure-Aware Geometric
Rectification module that hierarchically aligns 3D part structures with CLIP's
intermediate spatial priors through attention-driven geometric fusion.
Additionally, a Texture Amplification Module synthesizes minimal yet
discriminative textures to suppress noise and reinforce cross-modal
consistency. To further stabilize incremental prototypes, we employ a
Base-Novel Discriminator that isolates geometric variations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method significantly improves 3D few-shot
class-incremental learning, achieving superior geometric coherence and
robustness to texture bias across cross-domain and within-domain settings.

Conclusion: 这项工作开创了fMRI分析的新几何深度学习范式，显示了负曲GNN在计算精神病学领域的巨大潜力

Abstract: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) provides a powerful non-invasive
window into the brain's functional organization by generating complex
functional networks, typically modeled as graphs. These brain networks exhibit
a hierarchical topology that is crucial for cognitive processing. However, due
to inherent spatial constraints, standard Euclidean GNNs struggle to represent
these hierarchical structures without high distortion, limiting their clinical
performance. To address this limitation, we propose Brain-HGCN, a geometric
deep learning framework based on hyperbolic geometry, which leverages the
intrinsic property of negatively curved space to model the brain's network
hierarchy with high fidelity. Grounded in the Lorentz model, our model employs
a novel hyperbolic graph attention layer with a signed aggregation mechanism to
distinctly process excitatory and inhibitory connections, ultimately learning
robust graph-level representations via a geometrically sound Fr\'echet mean for
graph readout. Experiments on two large-scale fMRI datasets for psychiatric
disorder classification demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms
a wide range of state-of-the-art Euclidean baselines. This work pioneers a new
geometric deep learning paradigm for fMRI analysis, highlighting the immense
potential of hyperbolic GNNs in the field of computational psychiatry.

Motivation: 电商产品类别快速增长导致仓库自动化包装中的物体识别变得更加困难，传统仅依赖2D外观特征的方法在面临类内变异、视觉相似物品、遮挡和视角变化时性能急剧下降。

Method: 提出两阶段识别框架：第一阶段使用大型视觉模型提取2D特征生成候选排名；第二阶段通过轻量级3D特征感知模块判断是否需要3D重排序，使用机器人3D检索变换器进行几何感知的特征匹配。

Result: 实验显示RoboEye比之前最先进的方法(RoboLLM)在Recall@1指标上提升了7.1%，且仅需RGB图像，降低了部署成本。

Conclusion: RoboEye通过动态结合2D和3D推理有效解决了复杂场景下的物体识别问题，为大规模电商仓库自动化提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: The rapidly growing number of product categories in large-scale e-commerce
makes accurate object identification for automated packing in warehouses
substantially more difficult. As the catalog grows, intra-class variability and
a long tail of rare or visually similar items increase, and when combined with
diverse packaging, cluttered containers, frequent occlusion, and large
viewpoint changes-these factors amplify discrepancies between query and
reference images, causing sharp performance drops for methods that rely solely
on 2D appearance features. Thus, we propose RoboEye, a two-stage identification
framework that dynamically augments 2D semantic features with domain-adapted 3D
reasoning and lightweight adapters to bridge training deployment gaps. In the
first stage, we train a large vision model to extract 2D features for
generating candidate rankings. A lightweight 3D-feature-awareness module then
estimates 3D feature quality and predicts whether 3D re-ranking is necessary,
preventing performance degradation and avoiding unnecessary computation. When
invoked, the second stage uses our robot 3D retrieval transformer, comprising a
3D feature extractor that produces geometry-aware dense features and a
keypoint-based matcher that computes keypoint-correspondence confidences
between query and reference images instead of conventional cosine-similarity
scoring. Experiments show that RoboEye improves Recall@1 by 7.1% over the prior
state of the art (RoboLLM). Moreover, RoboEye operates using only RGB images,
avoiding reliance on explicit 3D inputs and reducing deployment costs. The code

Conclusion: 该双流程掩码方案作为即插即用组件，无需架构改变可雅入现有旋转不变框架，具有广泛兼容性

Abstract: Existing rotation-invariant point cloud masked autoencoders (MAE) rely on
random masking strategies that overlook geometric structure and semantic
coherence. Random masking treats patches independently, failing to capture
spatial relationships consistent across orientations and overlooking semantic
object parts that maintain identity regardless of rotation. We propose a
dual-stream masking approach combining 3D Spatial Grid Masking and Progressive
Semantic Masking to address these fundamental limitations. Grid masking creates
structured patterns through coordinate sorting to capture geometric
relationships that persist across different orientations, while semantic
masking uses attention-driven clustering to discover semantically meaningful
parts and maintain their coherence during masking. These complementary streams
are orchestrated via curriculum learning with dynamic weighting, progressing
from geometric understanding to semantic discovery. Designed as plug-and-play
components, our strategies integrate into existing rotation-invariant
frameworks without architectural changes, ensuring broad compatibility across
different approaches. Comprehensive experiments on ModelNet40, ScanObjectNN,
and OmniObject3D demonstrate consistent improvements across various rotation
scenarios, showing substantial performance gains over the baseline
rotation-invariant methods.

Result: 在超声报告生成任务中，EchoVLM相比Qwen2-VL在BLEU-1和ROUGE-1分数上分别提升了10.15和4.77分，表现出显著改进。

Conclusion: EchoVLM在提升超声影像诊断准确性方面具有巨大潜力，为未来临床应用提供了可行的技术解决方案，模型代码和权重已开源。

Abstract: Ultrasound imaging has become the preferred imaging modality for early cancer
screening due to its advantages of non-ionizing radiation, low cost, and
real-time imaging capabilities. However, conventional ultrasound diagnosis
heavily relies on physician expertise, presenting challenges of high
subjectivity and low diagnostic efficiency. Vision-language models (VLMs) offer
promising solutions for this issue, but existing general-purpose models
demonstrate limited knowledge in ultrasound medical tasks, with poor
generalization in multi-organ lesion recognition and low efficiency across
multi-task diagnostics. To address these limitations, we propose EchoVLM, a
vision-language model specifically designed for ultrasound medical imaging. The
model employs a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture trained on data spanning
seven anatomical regions. This design enables the model to perform multiple
tasks, including ultrasound report generation, diagnosis and visual
question-answering (VQA). The experimental results demonstrated that EchoVLM
achieved significant improvements of 10.15 and 4.77 points in BLEU-1 scores and
ROUGE-1 scores respectively compared to Qwen2-VL on the ultrasound report
generation task. These findings suggest that EchoVLM has substantial potential
to enhance diagnostic accuracy in ultrasound imaging, thereby providing a
viable technical solution for future clinical applications. Source code and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动3D建模耗时耗力，而现有的自动场景生成方法在视觉质量、多样性、语义一致性和用户控制方面存在挑战，主要瓶颈是缺乏大规模、高质量的专门数据集。

Method: 首先构建了一个大规模合成数据集（包12,328个结构化注释场景，57,440个房间，470万张照相级渲染图），然后提出SpatialGen多视角多模态激散模型，能够根据3D布局和参考图像（由文本提示生成）从任意视角生成外观、几何和语义分割图，保持多模态间的空间一致性。

Result: SpatialGen在实验中一贯生成优于之前方法的结果，能够生成高保真度、语义一致的3D室内场景。

Conclusion: 该研究为室内场景生成和理解领域提供了重要资源，通过开源数据集和模型来推动该领域的发展。

Abstract: Creating high-fidelity 3D models of indoor environments is essential for
applications in design, virtual reality, and robotics. However, manual 3D
modeling remains time-consuming and labor-intensive. While recent advances in
generative AI have enabled automated scene synthesis, existing methods often
face challenges in balancing visual quality, diversity, semantic consistency,
and user control. A major bottleneck is the lack of a large-scale, high-quality
dataset tailored to this task. To address this gap, we introduce a
comprehensive synthetic dataset, featuring 12,328 structured annotated scenes
with 57,440 rooms, and 4.7M photorealistic 2D renderings. Leveraging this
dataset, we present SpatialGen, a novel multi-view multi-modal diffusion model
that generates realistic and semantically consistent 3D indoor scenes. Given a
3D layout and a reference image (derived from a text prompt), our model
synthesizes appearance (color image), geometry (scene coordinate map), and
semantic (semantic segmentation map) from arbitrary viewpoints, while
preserving spatial consistency across modalities. SpatialGen consistently
generates superior results to previous methods in our experiments. We are
open-sourcing our data and models to empower the community and advance the
field of indoor scene understanding and generation.

TL;DR: PRISM是一种用于零售场景产品检索的混合方法，结合了视觉语言模型和像素级匹配的优势，通过三阶段处理实现高效精确检索


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统产品检索面临挑战：不同品牌的同类产品外观高度相似，查询图像角度与目录图像差异大。基础模型难以区分细微局部差异，而像素级匹配方法计算成本高、匹配时间长

Method: 三阶段混合方法：1) 使用SigLIP视觉语言模型检索前35个最相似产品，大幅缩小搜索空间；2) 应用YOLO-E分割模型消除背景干扰；3) 在筛选候选产品上使用LightGlue进行细粒度像素级匹配

Result: 在ABV数据集上的实验表明，PRISM在top-1准确率上比最先进的图像检索方法高出4.21%，同时仍保持在实时处理的范围内

Conclusion: PRISM框架通过结合语义相似性和细粒度像素匹配，能够更准确地区分具有高类间相似性的产品，专注于全局模型经常忽略的细微视觉线索，适用于实际零售部署

Abstract: Compared to traditional image retrieval tasks, product retrieval in retail
settings is even more challenging. Products of the same type from different
brands may have highly similar visual appearances, and the query image may be
taken from an angle that differs significantly from view angles of the stored
catalog images. Foundational models, such as CLIP and SigLIP, often struggle to
distinguish these subtle but important local differences. Pixel-wise matching
methods, on the other hand, are computationally expensive and incur
prohibitively high matching times. In this paper, we propose a new, hybrid
method, called PRISM, for product retrieval in retail settings by leveraging
the advantages of both vision-language model-based and pixel-wise matching
approaches. To provide both efficiency/speed and finegrained retrieval
accuracy, PRISM consists of three stages: 1) A vision-language model (SigLIP)
is employed first to retrieve the top 35 most semantically similar products
from a fixed gallery, thereby narrowing the search space significantly; 2) a
segmentation model (YOLO-E) is applied to eliminate background clutter; 3)
fine-grained pixel-level matching is performed using LightGlue across the
filtered candidates. This framework enables more accurate discrimination
between products with high inter-class similarity by focusing on subtle visual
cues often missed by global models. Experiments performed on the ABV dataset
show that our proposed PRISM outperforms the state-of-the-art image retrieval
methods by 4.21% in top-1 accuracy while still remaining within the bounds of
real-time processing for practical retail deployments.

existing competitive approaches in the joint task of wire detection and depth
estimation. Our results underscore the potential of our model to enhance the

Abstract: In recent years, the underwater image formation model has found extensive use
in the generation of synthetic underwater data. Although many approaches focus
on scenes primarily affected by discoloration, they often overlook the model's
ability to capture the complex, distance-dependent visibility loss present in
highly turbid environments. In this work, we propose an improved synthetic data
generation pipeline that includes the commonly omitted forward scattering term,
while also considering a nonuniform medium. Additionally, we collected the
BUCKET dataset under controlled turbidity conditions to acquire real turbid
footage with the corresponding reference images. Our results demonstrate
qualitative improvements over the reference model, particularly under
increasing turbidity, with a selection rate of 82. 5\% by survey participants.

Conclusion: 该方法通过知识蒸馏有效解决了多模态脑肿瘤分割中的模态缺失问题，为方法选择提供了实用指导，并确认了知识蒸馏策略的优越性。

Abstract: Accurate brain tumor segmentation is essential for preoperative evaluation
and personalized treatment. Multi-modal MRI is widely used due to its ability
to capture complementary tumor features across different sequences. However, in
clinical practice, missing modalities are common, limiting the robustness and
generalizability of existing deep learning methods that rely on complete
inputs, especially under non-dominant modality combinations. To address this,
we propose AdaMM, a multi-modal brain tumor segmentation framework tailored for
missing-modality scenarios, centered on knowledge distillation and composed of
three synergistic modules. The Graph-guided Adaptive Refinement Module
explicitly models semantic associations between generalizable and
modality-specific features, enhancing adaptability to modality absence. The
Bi-Bottleneck Distillation Module transfers structural and textural knowledge
from teacher to student models via global style matching and adversarial
feature alignment. The Lesion-Presence-Guided Reliability Module predicts prior
probabilities of lesion types through an auxiliary classification task,
effectively suppressing false positives under incomplete inputs. Extensive
experiments on the BraTS 2018 and 2024 datasets demonstrate that AdaMM
consistently outperforms existing methods, exhibiting superior segmentation
accuracy and robustness, particularly in single-modality and weak-modality
configurations. In addition, we conduct a systematic evaluation of six
categories of missing-modality strategies, confirming the superiority of
knowledge distillation and offering practical guidance for method selection and
future research. Our source code is available at

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have revolutionized text-guided image
editing, yet existing editing methods face critical challenges in
hyperparameter identification. To get the reasonable editing performance, these
methods often require the user to brute-force tune multiple interdependent
hyperparameters, such as inversion timesteps and attention modification,
\textit{etc.} This process incurs high computational costs due to the huge
hyperparameter search space. We consider searching optimal editing's
hyperparameters as a sequential decision-making task within the diffusion
denoising process. Specifically, we propose a reinforcement learning framework,
which establishes a Markov Decision Process that dynamically adjusts
hyperparameters across denoising steps, integrating editing objectives into a
reward function. The method achieves time efficiency through proximal policy
optimization while maintaining optimal hyperparameter configurations.
Experiments demonstrate significant reduction in search time and computational
overhead compared to existing brute-force approaches, advancing the practical
deployment of a diffusion-based image editing framework in the real world.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决视觉-语言-动作模型中动作预测的复杂性，并提高模型在下游机器人任务中的表现，需要开发更有效的预训练策略和动作表示方法。

Method: 提出两阶段预训练方法：第一阶段在1200万自我中心操作视频上进行图像到视频生成预训练；第二阶段通过联合预测未来关键点轨迹来桥接视觉帧预测和动作预测。使用ActionVAE变分自编码器压缩动作序列为紧凑潜在嵌入。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的两阶段预训练方法和ActionVAE动作压缩技术有效降低了VLA输出空间的复杂性，为视觉-语言-动作模型提供了更好的初始化方案，在机器人任务中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: This paper presents RynnVLA-001, a vision-language-action(VLA) model built
upon large-scale video generative pretraining from human demonstrations. We
propose a novel two-stage pretraining methodology. The first stage, Ego-Centric
Video Generative Pretraining, trains an Image-to-Video model on 12M ego-centric
manipulation videos to predict future frames conditioned on an initial frame
and a language instruction. The second stage, Human-Centric Trajectory-Aware
Modeling, extends this by jointly predicting future keypoint trajectories,
thereby effectively bridging visual frame prediction with action prediction.
Furthermore, to enhance action representation, we propose ActionVAE, a
variational autoencoder that compresses sequences of actions into compact
latent embeddings, reducing the complexity of the VLA output space. When
finetuned on the same downstream robotics datasets, RynnVLA-001 achieves
superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating that the
proposed pretraining strategy provides a more effective initialization for VLA
models.

Abstract: This paper addresses the synthetic-to-real domain gap in object detection,
focusing on training a YOLOv11 model to detect a specific object (a soup can)
using only synthetic data and domain randomization strategies. The methodology
involves extensive experimentation with data augmentation, dataset composition,
and model scaling. While synthetic validation metrics were consistently high,
they proved to be poor predictors of real-world performance. Consequently,
models were also evaluated qualitatively, through visual inspection of
predictions, and quantitatively, on a manually labeled real-world test set, to
guide development. Final mAP@50 scores were provided by the official Kaggle
competition. Key findings indicate that increasing synthetic dataset diversity,
specifically by including varied perspectives and complex backgrounds, combined
with carefully tuned data augmentation, were crucial in bridging the domain
gap. The best performing configuration, a YOLOv11l model trained on an expanded
and diverse dataset, achieved a final mAP@50 of 0.910 on the competition's
hidden test set. This result demonstrates the potential of a synthetic-only
training approach while also highlighting the remaining challenges in fully

Abstract: Trajectory prediction is a critical task in computer vision and autonomous
systems, playing a key role in autonomous driving, robotics, surveillance, and
virtual reality. Existing methods often rely on complete and noise-free
observational data, overlooking the challenges associated with out-of-sight
objects and the inherent noise in sensor data caused by limited camera
coverage, obstructions, and the absence of ground truth for denoised
trajectories. These limitations pose safety risks and hinder reliable
prediction in real-world scenarios. In this extended work, we present
advancements in Out-of-Sight Trajectory (OST), a novel task that predicts the
noise-free visual trajectories of out-of-sight objects using noisy sensor data.
Building on our previous research, we broaden the scope of Out-of-Sight
Trajectory Prediction (OOSTraj) to include pedestrians and vehicles, extending
its applicability to autonomous driving, robotics, surveillance, and virtual
reality. Our enhanced Vision-Positioning Denoising Module leverages camera
calibration to establish a vision-positioning mapping, addressing the lack of
visual references, while effectively denoising noisy sensor data in an
unsupervised manner. Through extensive evaluations on the Vi-Fi and JRDB
datasets, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in both trajectory
denoising and prediction, significantly surpassing previous baselines.
Additionally, we introduce comparisons with traditional denoising methods, such
as Kalman filtering, and adapt recent trajectory prediction models to our task,
providing a comprehensive benchmark. This work represents the first initiative
to integrate vision-positioning projection for denoising noisy sensor
trajectories of out-of-sight agents, paving the way for future advances. The

Motivation: 评估现有深度学习肺部分割模型在肺穿植预备患者中的应用性能，确定它们在不同病情严重程度、病理类型和肺侧的表现，以识别限制其在本前规划中应用的问题。

Method: 回须性研究包括32名患者的胸部CT扫描（共3,645张轴位切片）。使用三种现有深度学习模型（Unet-R231、TotalSegmentator、MedSAM）进行肺部分割，采用定量指标（体积相似性、Dice相似系数、Hausdorff距离）和四级临床可接受性评分进行性能评估。

Result: Unet-R231在各种情况下都显著优于其他两个模型（p<0.05）。所有模型在从轻度到中重度症状时性能显著下降，尤其是体积相似性指标（p<0.05），但肺侧或病理类型间没有显著差异。

Conclusion: Unet-R231是评估模型中最准确的自动肺部分割模型，TotalSegmentator次之，但它们在中重度病情下性能显著下降，强调了在严重病理情况下对专门模型调优的需要。

Abstract: This study evaluates publicly available deep-learning based lung segmentation
models in transplant-eligible patients to determine their performance across
disease severity levels, pathology categories, and lung sides, and to identify
limitations impacting their use in preoperative planning in lung
transplantation. This retrospective study included 32 patients who underwent
chest CT scans at Duke University Health System between 2017 and 2019 (total of
3,645 2D axial slices). Patients with standard axial CT scans were selected
based on the presence of two or more lung pathologies of varying severity. Lung
segmentation was performed using three previously developed deep learning
models: Unet-R231, TotalSegmentator, MedSAM. Performance was assessed using
quantitative metrics (volumetric similarity, Dice similarity coefficient,
Hausdorff distance) and a qualitative measure (four-point clinical
acceptability scale). Unet-R231 consistently outperformed TotalSegmentator and
MedSAM in general, for different severity levels, and pathology categories
(p<0.05). All models showed significant performance declines from mild to
moderate-to-severe cases, particularly in volumetric similarity (p<0.05),
without significant differences among lung sides or pathology types. Unet-R231
provided the most accurate automated lung segmentation among evaluated models
with TotalSegmentator being a close second, though their performance declined
significantly in moderate-to-severe cases, emphasizing the need for specialized
model fine-tuning in severe pathology contexts.

Abstract: Recent research on representation learning has proved the merits of
multi-modal clues for robust semantic segmentation. Nevertheless, a flexible
pretrain-and-finetune pipeline for multiple visual modalities remains
unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-modal learning framework,
termed OmniSegmentor. It has two key innovations: 1) Based on ImageNet, we
assemble a large-scale dataset for multi-modal pretraining, called ImageNeXt,
which contains five popular visual modalities. 2) We provide an efficient
pretraining manner to endow the model with the capacity to encode different
modality information in the ImageNeXt. For the first time, we introduce a
universal multi-modal pretraining framework that consistently amplifies the
model's perceptual capabilities across various scenarios, regardless of the
arbitrary combination of the involved modalities. Remarkably, our OmniSegmentor
achieves new state-of-the-art records on a wide range of multi-modal semantic

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种仅需单个RGB视频作为监督的动态场景相机参数优化方法，解决了COLMAP在动态场景中运行时间长、依赖真实运动掩码的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如COLMAP在动态场景中存在运行时间长、需要真实运动掩码等限制，而许多优化方法又依赖于充分的先验知识（如真实焦距、三维点云、相机姿态等），这些在普通手机拍摄的RGB视频中通常无法获得。

Method: 方法包含三个核心组件：(1)表面块跟踪筛波器，建立稳健的极稀疏关系；(2)离群点识别联合优化，通过自适应权重调整处理运动异常点；(3)两阶段优化策略，在Softplus限制和凸最小值之间找到平衡点提高稳定性和速度。

Result: 在4个实际数据集（NeRF-DS, DAVIS, iPhone, TUM-dynamics）和1个合成数据集（MPI-Sintel）上进行实验，结果显示该方法能够更高效、更准确地估计相机参数。通过将相机估计输入到4D重建方法进一步验证了准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法仅需单个RGB视频作为唯一监督，就能够在动态场景中实现更准确和高效的相机参数优化，免除了对充分先验知识的依赖，为普通视频的相机标定提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Although COLMAP has long remained the predominant method for camera parameter
optimization in static scenes, it is constrained by its lengthy runtime and
reliance on ground truth (GT) motion masks for application to dynamic scenes.
Many efforts attempted to improve it by incorporating more priors as
supervision such as GT focal length, motion masks, 3D point clouds, camera
poses, and metric depth, which, however, are typically unavailable in casually
captured RGB videos. In this paper, we propose a novel method for more accurate
and efficient camera parameter optimization in dynamic scenes solely supervised
by a single RGB video. Our method consists of three key components: (1)
Patch-wise Tracking Filters, to establish robust and maximally sparse
hinge-like relations across the RGB video. (2) Outlier-aware Joint
Optimization, for efficient camera parameter optimization by adaptive
down-weighting of moving outliers, without reliance on motion priors. (3) A
Two-stage Optimization Strategy, to enhance stability and optimization speed by
a trade-off between the Softplus limits and convex minima in losses. We
visually and numerically evaluate our camera estimates. To further validate
accuracy, we feed the camera estimates into a 4D reconstruction method and
assess the resulting 3D scenes, and rendered 2D RGB and depth maps. We perform
experiments on 4 real-world datasets (NeRF-DS, DAVIS, iPhone, and TUM-dynamics)
and 1 synthetic dataset (MPI-Sintel), demonstrating that our method estimates
camera parameters more efficiently and accurately with a single RGB video as
the only supervision.

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段使用伪标签监督微调(SFT)整合外部事实专业知识；第二阶段应用组相对策略优化(GRPO)配合四个定制的事实奖励信号来鼓励自一致推理

Result: 在三个公开医疗QA基准测试中，相比之前最先进方法实现了22.5%的绝对改进，消融研究验证了伪标签SFT冷启动的必要性和各GRPO奖励的贡献

Conclusion: 知识基础与RL驱动推理的协同作用对于可信医疗AI至关重要，该框架显著提升了医疗视觉语言模型的事实准确性

Abstract: Ensuring factual consistency and reliable reasoning remains a critical
challenge for medical vision-language models. We introduce MEDFACT-R1, a
two-stage framework that integrates external knowledge grounding with
reinforcement learning to improve the factual medical reasoning. The first
stage uses pseudo-label supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to incorporate external
factual expertise; while the second stage applies Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) with four tailored factual reward signals to encourage
self-consistent reasoning. Across three public medical QA benchmarks,
MEDFACT-R1 delivers up to 22.5% absolute improvement in factual accuracy over
previous state-of-the-art methods. Ablation studies highlight the necessity of
pseudo-label SFT cold start and validate the contribution of each GRPO reward,
underscoring the synergy between knowledge grounding and RL-driven reasoning
for trustworthy medical AI. Codes are released at

TL;DR: 将几何视觉错觉作为辅助监督任务可以系统性地提升图像分类模型的泛化能力，特别是在处理复杂轮廓和精细纹理的挑战性视觉案例中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当代深度学习模型主要依赖大数据集的统计规律，但很少融入来自感知心理学的结构化洞察。研究者希望探索感知驱动的归纳偏置在提升视觉模型性能方面的潜力。

Method: 创建了一个合成的参数化几何错觉数据集，并评估了三种多源学习策略，将错觉识别任务与ImageNet分类目标相结合。

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了感知科学与机器学习的新颖整合，为将感知先验嵌入视觉模型设计提供了新方向。

Abstract: Contemporary deep learning models have achieved impressive performance in
image classification by primarily leveraging statistical regularities within
large datasets, but they rarely incorporate structured insights drawn directly
from perceptual psychology. To explore the potential of perceptually motivated
inductive biases, we propose integrating classic geometric visual illusions
well-studied phenomena from human perception into standard image-classification
training pipelines. Specifically, we introduce a synthetic, parametric
geometric-illusion dataset and evaluate three multi-source learning strategies
that combine illusion recognition tasks with ImageNet classification
objectives. Our experiments reveal two key conceptual insights: (i)
incorporating geometric illusions as auxiliary supervision systematically
improves generalization, especially in visually challenging cases involving
intricate contours and fine textures; and (ii) perceptually driven inductive
biases, even when derived from synthetic stimuli traditionally considered
unrelated to natural image recognition, can enhance the structural sensitivity
of both CNN and transformer-based architectures. These results demonstrate a
novel integration of perceptual science and machine learning and suggest new
directions for embedding perceptual priors into vision model design.

*Saket S. Chaturvedi,Gaurav Bagwe,Lan Zhang,Xiaoyong Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对检索增强生成(RAG)系统的新型攻击方法AIP，通过操纵指令提示而非用户查询来隐蔽地改变检索行为，揭示了RAG系统中被忽视的安全漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG攻击主要依赖操纵用户查询，这在实践中往往不可行。指令提示被广泛重用、公开分享且很少审计，其隐含的信任使其成为攻击者操纵RAG行为的理想目标。

Method: 提出AIP攻击方法，使用多样化查询生成策略模拟真实语言变化，并基于遗传算法进行联合优化，平衡攻击成功率、清洁任务效用和隐蔽性。

Result: 实验结果显示AIP攻击成功率高达95.23%，同时保持良性功能，证明了指令提示操纵的有效性。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了RAG系统中一个关键且先前被忽视的漏洞，强调需要重新评估共享指令提示的安全性。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
retrieving relevant documents from external sources to improve factual accuracy
and verifiability. However, this reliance introduces new attack surfaces within
the retrieval pipeline, beyond the LLM itself. While prior RAG attacks have
exposed such vulnerabilities, they largely rely on manipulating user queries,
which is often infeasible in practice due to fixed or protected user inputs.
This narrow focus overlooks a more realistic and stealthy vector: instructional
prompts, which are widely reused, publicly shared, and rarely audited. Their
implicit trust makes them a compelling target for adversaries to manipulate RAG
behavior covertly.
  We introduce a novel attack for Adversarial Instructional Prompt (AIP) that
exploits adversarial instructional prompts to manipulate RAG outputs by subtly
altering retrieval behavior. By shifting the attack surface to the
instructional prompts, AIP reveals how trusted yet seemingly benign interface
components can be weaponized to degrade system integrity. The attack is crafted
to achieve three goals: (1) naturalness, to evade user detection; (2) utility,
to encourage use of prompts; and (3) robustness, to remain effective across
diverse query variations. We propose a diverse query generation strategy that
simulates realistic linguistic variation in user queries, enabling the
discovery of prompts that generalize across paraphrases and rephrasings.
Building on this, a genetic algorithm-based joint optimization is developed to
evolve adversarial prompts by balancing attack success, clean-task utility, and
stealthiness. Experimental results show that AIP achieves up to 95.23% ASR
while preserving benign functionality. These findings uncover a critical and
previously overlooked vulnerability in RAG systems, emphasizing the need to
reassess the shared instructional prompts.

Motivation: 解决3D医学图像分割中标注数据稀缺的问题，利用丰富的2D自然图像预训练模型知识来提升分割性能

Method: 模型无关框架，通过迭代协同训练和伪掩码生成，结合学习率引导采样自适应调整标注和未标注数据比例

Result: 在多个公开数据集上超越13种现有半监督分割方法，达到最先进性能，且具有模型无关的适应性

Conclusion: M&N框架有效解决了3D医学图像分割中的标注数据稀缺问题，为未来更先进模型的集成提供了灵活性和可扩展性

Abstract: This paper explores the transfer of knowledge from general vision models
pretrained on 2D natural images to improve 3D medical image segmentation. We
focus on the semi-supervised setting, where only a few labeled 3D medical
images are available, along with a large set of unlabeled images. To tackle
this, we propose a model-agnostic framework that progressively distills
knowledge from a 2D pretrained model to a 3D segmentation model trained from
scratch. Our approach, M&N, involves iterative co-training of the two models
using pseudo-masks generated by each other, along with our proposed learning
rate guided sampling that adaptively adjusts the proportion of labeled and
unlabeled data in each training batch to align with the models' prediction
accuracy and stability, minimizing the adverse effect caused by inaccurate
pseudo-masks. Extensive experiments on multiple publicly available datasets
demonstrate that M&N achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming
thirteen existing semi-supervised segmentation approaches under all different
settings. Importantly, ablation studies show that M&N remains model-agnostic,
allowing seamless integration with different architectures. This ensures its
adaptability as more advanced models emerge. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出RA-GAN模型解决亲属验证中的年龄差距问题，通过RACEpSp和特征混合器模块生成无种族偏见的面部老化图像，显著提升了亲属验证准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 亲属验证中父母与子女照片存在年龄差距，且同年龄段照片往往不可得，现有面部老化模型存在种族偏见，影响照片相似度判断。

Method: 提出RA-GAN模型，包含RACEpSp和特征混合器两个新模块，用于生成无种族偏见的合成图像，并将父母和子女图像转换到相同年龄进行亲属验证。

Result: RA-GAN在所有年龄组平均比SAM-GAN提升13.14%，在60+年龄组比CUSP-GAN提升9.1%。在KinFaceW-I数据集上，父子、父女、母子、母女关系的验证准确率分别提升5.22%、5.12%、1.63%、0.41%。

Conclusion: RA-GAN能有效消除面部老化中的种族偏见，更好地保持身份特征，显著提升跨年龄亲属验证的准确性。

Abstract: The age gap in kinship verification addresses the time difference between the
photos of the parent and the child. Moreover, their same-age photos are often
unavailable, and face aging models are racially biased, which impacts the
likeness of photos. Therefore, we propose a face aging GAN model, RA-GAN,
consisting of two new modules, RACEpSp and a feature mixer, to produce racially
unbiased images. The unbiased synthesized photos are used in kinship
verification to investigate the results of verifying same-age parent-child
images. The experiments demonstrate that our RA-GAN outperforms SAM-GAN on an
average of 13.14\% across all age groups, and CUSP-GAN in the 60+ age group by
9.1\% in terms of racial accuracy. Moreover, RA-GAN can preserve subjects'
identities better than SAM-GAN and CUSP-GAN across all age groups.
Additionally, we demonstrate that transforming parent and child images from the
KinFaceW-I and KinFaceW-II datasets to the same age can enhance the
verification accuracy across all age groups. The accuracy increases with our
RA-GAN for the kinship relationships of father-son and father-daughter,
mother-son, and mother-daughter, which are 5.22, 5.12, 1.63, and 0.41,
respectively, on KinFaceW-I. Additionally, the accuracy for the relationships
of father-daughter, father-son, and mother-son is 2.9, 0.39, and 1.6 on
KinFaceW-II, respectively. The code is available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决MLLMs在时空视频基准中存在的两个问题：动态分配基准标记的偏好，以及无法充分整合文本查询中的类型和动作等线索导致的次优基准

Method: 提出解耠式时空突出策略(DSTH)和时间增强组装策略(TAS)。DSTH将查询解耠为属性和动作子查询，使用新的对数导向重关注模块学习空间和时间提示。TAS通过时间增强框架组装预测来提高时间一致性

Result: 在三个常见STVG测试集上超越了当前最先进方法

Conclusion: 该方法有效地解锁了MLLMs在零样本时空视频基准中的推理能力，为该领域提供了一种新的解决方案

Abstract: Spatio-temporal video grounding (STVG) aims at localizing the spatio-temporal
tube of a video, as specified by the input text query. In this paper, we
utilize multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to explore a zero-shot
solution in STVG. We reveal two key insights about MLLMs: (1) MLLMs tend to
dynamically assign special tokens, referred to as \textit{grounding tokens},
for grounding the text query; and (2) MLLMs often suffer from suboptimal
grounding due to the inability to fully integrate the cues in the text query
(\textit{e.g.}, attributes, actions) for inference. Based on these insights, we
propose a MLLM-based zero-shot framework for STVG, which includes novel
decomposed spatio-temporal highlighting (DSTH) and temporal-augmented
assembling (TAS) strategies to unleash the reasoning ability of MLLMs. The DSTH
strategy first decouples the original query into attribute and action
sub-queries for inquiring the existence of the target both spatially and
temporally. It then uses a novel logit-guided re-attention (LRA) module to
learn latent variables as spatial and temporal prompts, by regularizing token
predictions for each sub-query. These prompts highlight attribute and action
cues, respectively, directing the model's attention to reliable spatial and
temporal related visual regions. In addition, as the spatial grounding by the
attribute sub-query should be temporally consistent, we introduce the TAS
strategy to assemble the predictions using the original video frames and the
temporal-augmented frames as inputs to help improve temporal consistency. We
evaluate our method on various MLLMs, and show that it outperforms SOTA methods
on three common STVG benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MSDD是一个高质量玉米幼苗航空图像数据集，用于植株计数，包含单株、双株和三株三类，在V4-V6生长阶段和天底视角下检测效果最佳。YOLO11速度最快，YOLOv9在单株检测中准确率最高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 精准农业需要准确的玉米幼苗检测，但现有标注数据集稀缺。传统人工计数方法劳动密集且易出错，计算机视觉可以提供高效准确的检测方案。

Method: 构建MSDD数据集，包含三类玉米植株（单株、双株、三株），涵盖不同生长阶段、种植设置、土壤类型、光照条件、相机角度和密度。使用YOLO系列模型进行基准测试。

Result: 单株检测精度达0.984，召回率0.873。双株和三株检测较困难，主要由于稀有性和不规则外观。YOLO11推理速度35ms/图像，YOLOv9在单株检测中准确率最高。

Conclusion: MSDD为开发增强植株计数、优化资源分配和支持实时决策的模型奠定了坚实基础，推动了农业监测自动化和精准农业的发展。

Abstract: Accurate maize seedling detection is crucial for precision agriculture, yet
curated datasets remain scarce. We introduce MSDD, a high-quality aerial image
dataset for maize seedling stand counting, with applications in early-season
crop monitoring, yield prediction, and in-field management. Stand counting
determines how many plants germinated, guiding timely decisions such as
replanting or adjusting inputs. Traditional methods are labor-intensive and
error-prone, while computer vision enables efficient, accurate detection. MSDD
contains three classes-single, double, and triple plants-capturing diverse
growth stages, planting setups, soil types, lighting conditions, camera angles,
and densities, ensuring robustness for real-world use. Benchmarking shows
detection is most reliable during V4-V6 stages and under nadir views. Among
tested models, YOLO11 is fastest, while YOLOv9 yields the highest accuracy for
single plants. Single plant detection achieves precision up to 0.984 and recall
up to 0.873, but detecting doubles and triples remains difficult due to rarity
and irregular appearance, often from planting errors. Class imbalance further
reduces accuracy in multi-plant detection. Despite these challenges, YOLO11
maintains efficient inference at 35 ms per image, with an additional 120 ms for
saving outputs. MSDD establishes a strong foundation for developing models that
enhance stand counting, optimize resource allocation, and support real-time
decision-making. This dataset marks a step toward automating agricultural
monitoring and advancing precision agriculture.

Conclusion: 自监督目标可以有效解决自回归模型在视觉领域的核心问题，ST-AR框架为视觉自回归模型提供了有效的训练方法

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated the importance of high-quality visual
representations in image generation and have highlighted the limitations of
generative models in image understanding. As a generative paradigm originally
designed for natural language, autoregressive models face similar challenges.
In this work, we present the first systematic investigation into the mechanisms
of applying the next-token prediction paradigm to the visual domain. We
identify three key properties that hinder the learning of high-level visual
semantics: local and conditional dependence, inter-step semantic inconsistency,
and spatial invariance deficiency. We show that these issues can be effectively
addressed by introducing self-supervised objectives during training, leading to
a novel training framework, Self-guided Training for AutoRegressive models
(ST-AR). Without relying on pre-trained representation models, ST-AR
significantly enhances the image understanding ability of autoregressive models
and leads to improved generation quality. Specifically, ST-AR brings
approximately 42% FID improvement for LlamaGen-L and 49% FID improvement for
LlamaGen-XL, while maintaining the same sampling strategy.

Motivation: 现有水印方法对几何变换（如裁剪、旋转）的鲁棒性不足，需要一种专门的方法来增强图像同步能力，准确估计和反转几何变换。

Method: 使用嵌入网络对图像进行不可感知的修改，提取网络预测图像所经历的几何变换参数，结合判别器保持高感知质量，端到端训练最小化预测与真实变换参数之间的误差。

Result: 实验验证表明该方法在各种几何和值度量变换上有效，能准确同步图像，并能有效提升现有水印方法对几何变换的抵抗力。

Conclusion: SyncSeal为图像同步提供了一种有效的水印解决方案，能够显著增强现有水印方法对几何攻击的鲁棒性，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Synchronization is the task of estimating and inverting geometric
transformations (e.g., crop, rotation) applied to an image. This work
introduces SyncSeal, a bespoke watermarking method for robust image
synchronization, which can be applied on top of existing watermarking methods
to enhance their robustness against geometric transformations. It relies on an
embedder network that imperceptibly alters images and an extractor network that
predicts the geometric transformation to which the image was subjected. Both
networks are end-to-end trained to minimize the error between the predicted and
ground-truth parameters of the transformation, combined with a discriminator to
maintain high perceptual quality. We experimentally validate our method on a
wide variety of geometric and valuemetric transformations, demonstrating its
effectiveness in accurately synchronizing images. We further show that our
synchronization can effectively upgrade existing watermarking methods to
withstand geometric transformations to which they were previously vulnerable.

Conclusion: 扩散模型成功应用于MVS任务，在保持高效率的同时显著提升了3D重建性能，为MVS领域提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: To reconstruct the 3D geometry from calibrated images, learning-based
multi-view stereo (MVS) methods typically perform multi-view depth estimation
and then fuse depth maps into a mesh or point cloud. To improve the
computational efficiency, many methods initialize a coarse depth map and then
gradually refine it in higher resolutions. Recently, diffusion models achieve
great success in generation tasks. Starting from a random noise, diffusion
models gradually recover the sample with an iterative denoising process. In
this paper, we propose a novel MVS framework, which introduces diffusion models
in MVS. Specifically, we formulate depth refinement as a conditional diffusion
process. Considering the discriminative characteristic of depth estimation, we
design a condition encoder to guide the diffusion process. To improve
efficiency, we propose a novel diffusion network combining lightweight 2D U-Net
and convolutional GRU. Moreover, we propose a novel confidence-based sampling
strategy to adaptively sample depth hypotheses based on the confidence
estimated by diffusion model. Based on our novel MVS framework, we propose two
novel MVS methods, DiffMVS and CasDiffMVS. DiffMVS achieves competitive
performance with state-of-the-art efficiency in run-time and GPU memory.
CasDiffMVS achieves state-of-the-art performance on DTU, Tanks & Temples and

Method: 提出跨模态萌荐范式，利用视觉基础模型生成密集代理深度标签；提出两种模型结构：基于Depth Anything v2的普通模型和新的循环结构模型。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上评估，i）跨模态萌荐方法在不需昂贵深度标注的情况下达到了与全监督方法相当的性能；ii）基于VFM的模型实现了状态分析上最优的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了事件相机深度估计中的标注数据缺乏问题，通过跨模态萌荐和基础模型适配，在不依赖昂贵标注的情况下实现了高性能的深度估计。

Abstract: Event cameras capture sparse, high-temporal-resolution visual information,
making them particularly suitable for challenging environments with high-speed
motion and strongly varying lighting conditions. However, the lack of large
datasets with dense ground-truth depth annotations hinders learning-based
monocular depth estimation from event data. To address this limitation, we
propose a cross-modal distillation paradigm to generate dense proxy labels
leveraging a Vision Foundation Model (VFM). Our strategy requires an event
stream spatially aligned with RGB frames, a simple setup even available
off-the-shelf, and exploits the robustness of large-scale VFMs. Additionally,
we propose to adapt VFMs, either a vanilla one like Depth Anything v2 (DAv2),
or deriving from it a novel recurrent architecture to infer depth from
monocular event cameras. We evaluate our approach with synthetic and real-world
datasets, demonstrating that i) our cross-modal paradigm achieves competitive
performance compared to fully supervised methods without requiring expensive
depth annotations, and ii) our VFM-based models achieve state-of-the-art
performance.

Conclusion: CalibPrompt是首个专门针对Med-VLMs置信度校准的框架，有效解决了医疗AI系统中置信度可靠性问题，为临床决策提供了更可信的预测结果。

Abstract: Medical Vision-Language Models (Med-VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
performance across diverse medical imaging tasks by leveraging large-scale
image-text pretraining. However, their confidence calibration is largely
unexplored, and so remains a significant challenge. As such, miscalibrated
predictions can lead to overconfident errors, undermining clinical trust and
decision-making reliability. To address this, we introduce CalibPrompt, the
first framework to calibrate Med-VLMs during prompt tuning. CalibPrompt
optimizes a small set of learnable prompts with carefully designed calibration
objectives under scarce labeled data regime. First, we study a regularizer that
attempts to align the smoothed accuracy with the predicted model confidences.
Second, we introduce an angular separation loss to maximize textual feature
proximity toward improving the reliability in confidence estimates of
multimodal Med-VLMs. Extensive experiments on four publicly available Med-VLMs
and five diverse medical imaging datasets reveal that CalibPrompt consistently
improves calibration without drastically affecting clean accuracy. Our code is
available at https://github.com/iabh1shekbasu/CalibPrompt.

TL;DR: AEGIS是一个自动化错误生成和识别框架，通过向成功的多智能体系统轨迹中注入可控错误来创建大规模错误数据集，显著提升了错误识别的模型性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体系统日益复杂，但缺乏大规模、多样化的错误标注数据集，严重阻碍了系统可靠性和安全性研究

Method: 使用基于LLM的上下文感知自适应操纵器，通过提示注入和响应破坏等复杂攻击方式，在成功轨迹中系统性地注入可控可追踪的错误

Result: 在监督微调、强化学习和对比学习三种学习范式下，使用AEGIS数据训练的模型都取得了显著性能提升，部分模型性能可与大一个数量级的专有系统相媲美

Conclusion: AEGIS框架为开发更鲁棒和可解释的多智能体系统提供了关键的数据资源，自动化数据生成方法具有重要价值

Abstract: As Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) become increasingly autonomous and complex,
understanding their error modes is critical for ensuring their reliability and
safety. However, research in this area has been severely hampered by the lack
of large-scale, diverse datasets with precise, ground-truth error labels. To
address this bottleneck, we introduce \textbf{AEGIS}, a novel framework for
\textbf{A}utomated \textbf{E}rror \textbf{G}eneration and
\textbf{I}dentification for Multi-Agent \textbf{S}ystems. By systematically
injecting controllable and traceable errors into initially successful
trajectories, we create a rich dataset of realistic failures. This is achieved
using a context-aware, LLM-based adaptive manipulator that performs
sophisticated attacks like prompt injection and response corruption to induce
specific, predefined error modes. We demonstrate the value of our dataset by
exploring three distinct learning paradigms for the error identification task:
Supervised Fine-Tuning, Reinforcement Learning, and Contrastive Learning. Our
comprehensive experiments show that models trained on AEGIS data achieve
substantial improvements across all three learning paradigms. Notably, several
of our fine-tuned models demonstrate performance competitive with or superior
to proprietary systems an order of magnitude larger, validating our automated
data generation framework as a crucial resource for developing more robust and
interpretable multi-agent systems. Our project website is available at

TL;DR: FlowDrive是一个端到端自动驾驶框架，通过引入物理可解释的能量流场（风险势场和车道吸引场）来编码语义先验和安全提示，提升运动规划的安全性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有端到端自动驾驶框架依赖隐式学习的BEV特征，缺乏对风险和引导先验的显式建模，无法实现安全可解释的规划。

Method: 提出FlowDrive框架：1）引入风险势场和车道吸引场编码语义先验；2）使用条件扩散规划器解耦运动意图预测和轨迹去噪；3）通过特征级门控增强多模态多样性。

Result: 在NAVSIM v2基准测试中达到86.3的EPDMS分数，在安全性和规划质量方面均超越现有基线方法。

Conclusion: FlowDrive通过显式建模风险流场和解耦规划过程，实现了更安全、可解释且性能优越的自动驾驶运动规划。

Abstract: Recent advances in end-to-end autonomous driving leverage multi-view images
to construct BEV representations for motion planning. In motion planning,
autonomous vehicles need considering both hard constraints imposed by
geometrically occupied obstacles (e.g., vehicles, pedestrians) and soft,
rule-based semantics with no explicit geometry (e.g., lane boundaries, traffic
priors). However, existing end-to-end frameworks typically rely on BEV features
learned in an implicit manner, lacking explicit modeling of risk and guidance
priors for safe and interpretable planning. To address this, we propose
FlowDrive, a novel framework that introduces physically interpretable
energy-based flow fields-including risk potential and lane attraction fields-to
encode semantic priors and safety cues into the BEV space. These flow-aware
features enable adaptive refinement of anchor trajectories and serve as
interpretable guidance for trajectory generation. Moreover, FlowDrive decouples
motion intent prediction from trajectory denoising via a conditional diffusion
planner with feature-level gating, alleviating task interference and enhancing
multimodal diversity. Experiments on the NAVSIM v2 benchmark demonstrate that
FlowDrive achieves state-of-the-art performance with an EPDMS of 86.3,
surpassing prior baselines in both safety and planning quality. The project is
available at https://astrixdrive.github.io/FlowDrive.github.io/.

TL;DR: 使用多四足机器人通过接触力协调运输无法抓取的物体，无需通信或中央控制，通过奖励设计使机器人像硬连接一样协同工作


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决无法通过机械耦合连接的多机器人协同运输问题，通过纯粹接触力协调实现去中心化控制

Method: 采用层次策略架构，分离基底移动和手臂控制，使用星座奖励公式统一位置和方位跟踪，通过奖励设计和训练课程使机器人像硬连接一样行动

Result: 在模拟中展示了从2到10个机器人的稳健运输能力，适用于多种物体形状和质量，并实现了从模拟到实际的转移

Conclusion: 通过共享策略参数和隐式同步线索，方法可以扩展到任意团队规模而无需重新训练，为去中心化协作运输提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: We study decentralized cooperative transport using teams of N-quadruped
robots with arm that must pinch, lift, and move ungraspable objects through
physical contact alone. Unlike prior work that relies on rigid mechanical
coupling between robots and objects, we address the more challenging setting
where mechanically independent robots must coordinate through contact forces
alone without any communication or centralized control. To this end, we employ
a hierarchical policy architecture that separates base locomotion from arm
control, and propose a constellation reward formulation that unifies position
and orientation tracking to enforce rigid contact behavior. The key insight is
encouraging robots to behave as if rigidly connected to the object through
careful reward design and training curriculum rather than explicit mechanical
constraints. Our approach enables coordination through shared policy parameters
and implicit synchronization cues - scaling to arbitrary team sizes without
retraining. We show extensive simulation experiments to demonstrate robust
transport across 2-10 robots on diverse object geometries and masses, along
with sim2real transfer results on lightweight objects.

Abstract: We introduce LeVR, a modular software framework designed to bridge two
critical gaps in robotic imitation learning. First, it provides robust and
intuitive virtual reality (VR) teleoperation for data collection using robot

Method: 使用人类运动数据训练扩散先验模型，然后用这个先验来指导强化学习策略在仿真环境中完成特定任务

Result: 该方法能够发现直接RL无法获得的解决方案，扩散模型自然促进动作的自然性，有助于仿真到现实的迁移

Conclusion: DreamControl在Unitree G1机器人上验证有效，能够处理涉及上下半身同时控制和物体交互的复杂任务

Abstract: We introduce DreamControl, a novel methodology for learning autonomous
whole-body humanoid skills. DreamControl leverages the strengths of diffusion
models and Reinforcement Learning (RL): our core innovation is the use of a
diffusion prior trained on human motion data, which subsequently guides an RL
policy in simulation to complete specific tasks of interest (e.g., opening a
drawer or picking up an object). We demonstrate that this human motion-informed
prior allows RL to discover solutions unattainable by direct RL, and that
diffusion models inherently promote natural looking motions, aiding in
sim-to-real transfer. We validate DreamControl's effectiveness on a Unitree G1
robot across a diverse set of challenging tasks involving simultaneous lower
and upper body control and object interaction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体强化学习在机器人应用中面临高维连续动作空间、复杂奖励设计和非平稳转换等挑战，而人类通过分阶段课程学习复杂协调行为，这启发了使用基础模型作为教练的框架设计

Method: 使用大型语言模型(LLM)的规划能力自动分解长时程协调任务为子任务序列，用LLM生成每个子任务的奖励函数，通过视觉语言模型(VLM)指导的奖励精炼循环进行训练

Result: 在多四足机器人导航和双手操作任务上验证了学习复杂协调行为的能力，并在真实硬件实验中验证了多四足机器人导航策略

Conclusion: CRAFT框架成功利用基础模型的推理能力，通过自动任务分解和奖励生成，有效解决了多机器人协调中的复杂强化学习挑战

Abstract: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) provides a powerful framework for
learning coordination in multi-agent systems. However, applying MARL to
robotics still remains challenging due to high-dimensional continuous joint
action spaces, complex reward design, and non-stationary transitions inherent
to decentralized settings. On the other hand, humans learn complex coordination
through staged curricula, where long-horizon behaviors are progressively built
upon simpler skills. Motivated by this, we propose CRAFT: Coaching
Reinforcement learning Autonomously using Foundation models for multi-robot
coordination Tasks, a framework that leverages the reasoning capabilities of
foundation models to act as a "coach" for multi-robot coordination. CRAFT
automatically decomposes long-horizon coordination tasks into sequences of
subtasks using the planning capability of Large Language Models (LLMs). In what
follows, CRAFT trains each subtask using reward functions generated by LLM, and
refines them through a Vision Language Model (VLM)-guided reward-refinement
loop. We evaluate CRAFT on multi-quadruped navigation and bimanual manipulation
tasks, demonstrating its capability to learn complex coordination behaviors. In
addition, we validate the multi-quadruped navigation policy in real hardware
experiments.

TL;DR: RLBind是一个两阶段对抗不变性跨模态对齐框架，通过无监督微调硬化视觉编码器，并利用跨模态对应性最小化干净/对抗特征与文本锚点之间的差异，同时强制跨模态的类级分布对齐，显著提升了多模态编码器的鲁棒性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人部署中视觉分支面临对抗性和自然损坏，需要鲁棒性作为安全前提。现有方法通常在CLIP风格编码器中对齐干净和对抗特征，但忽视了更广泛的跨模态对应性，导致增益有限且往往损害零样本迁移能力。

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段对干净-对抗对进行无监督微调以硬化视觉编码器；第二阶段利用跨模态对应性，最小化干净/对抗特征与文本锚点之间的差异，同时强制跨模态的类级分布对齐。

Result: 在图像、音频、热成像和视频数据上的广泛实验表明，RLBind在干净准确率和规范有界对抗鲁棒性方面始终优于LanguageBind主干和标准微调基线。

Conclusion: RLBind在不牺牲泛化能力的情况下提高了弹性，为具身机器人在导航、操作和其他自主设置中提供了更安全的多传感器感知堆栈的实用路径。

Abstract: Unified multi-modal encoders that bind vision, audio, and other sensors into
a shared embedding space are attractive building blocks for robot perception
and decision-making. However, on-robot deployment exposes the vision branch to
adversarial and natural corruptions, making robustness a prerequisite for
safety. Prior defenses typically align clean and adversarial features within
CLIP-style encoders and overlook broader cross-modal correspondence, yielding
modest gains and often degrading zero-shot transfer. We introduce RLBind, a
two-stage adversarial-invariant cross-modal alignment framework for robust
unified embeddings. Stage 1 performs unsupervised fine-tuning on
clean-adversarial pairs to harden the visual encoder. Stage 2 leverages
cross-modal correspondence by minimizing the discrepancy between
clean/adversarial features and a text anchor, while enforcing class-wise
distributional alignment across modalities. Extensive experiments on Image,
Audio, Thermal, and Video data show that RLBind consistently outperforms the
LanguageBind backbone and standard fine-tuning baselines in both clean accuracy
and norm-bounded adversarial robustness. By improving resilience without
sacrificing generalization, RLBind provides a practical path toward safer
multi-sensor perception stacks for embodied robots in navigation, manipulation,
and other autonomy settings.

TL;DR: GestOS是一个基于手势的操作系统，通过语义理解手势意图并动态分配任务给多机器人团队，结合视觉感知和LLM推理实现智能协调控制


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有手势控制系统通常将手势映射为固定命令或单机器人动作，缺乏对多机器人团队的语义理解和动态任务分配能力，需要更智能的协调控制方案

Method: 结合轻量级视觉感知和大型语言模型推理：将手势姿态转换为结构化文本描述，LLM推断用户意图并生成机器人特定命令，实时匹配最适合的机器人执行任务

Result: 实现了上下文感知的自适应控制，无需用户明确指定目标或命令，支持在动态环境中与机器人系统进行可扩展、灵活和用户友好的协作

Conclusion: GestOS将手势交互从简单识别推进到智能协调，为异构机器人团队提供了语义理解和动态任务分配的高级控制能力

Abstract: We present GestOS, a gesture-based operating system for high-level control of
heterogeneous robot teams. Unlike prior systems that map gestures to fixed
commands or single-agent actions, GestOS interprets hand gestures semantically
and dynamically distributes tasks across multiple robots based on their
capabilities, current state, and supported instruction sets. The system
combines lightweight visual perception with large language model (LLM)
reasoning: hand poses are converted into structured textual descriptions, which
the LLM uses to infer intent and generate robot-specific commands. A robot
selection module ensures that each gesture-triggered task is matched to the
most suitable agent in real time. This architecture enables context-aware,
adaptive control without requiring explicit user specification of targets or
commands. By advancing gesture interaction from recognition to intelligent
orchestration, GestOS supports scalable, flexible, and user-friendly
collaboration with robotic systems in dynamic environments.

TL;DR: 提出基于3D高斯泼溅的碰撞锥安全滤波器，通过解析几何方法构建一阶控制屏障函数，实现高效、主动的避障规划


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于距离的CBF方法反应滞后，只在障碍物接近时才激活，导致轨迹抖动且计算成本高。需要一种能提前预警、计算高效的安全滤波器

Method: 将每个3D高斯泼溅转换为闭式前向碰撞锥，构建一阶CBF并嵌入二次规划框架。利用Minkowski和扩展处理机器人物理尺寸

Result: 在17万泼溅的大场景中，规划时间减少3倍，轨迹抖动显著降低，同时保持相同安全水平

Conclusion: 该方法完全解析、无需高阶CBF扩展，计算高效，适用于实时导航，特别适合空间机器人和卫星系统等极端环境

Abstract: We present a perception-driven safety filter that converts each 3D Gaussian
Splat (3DGS) into a closed-form forward collision cone, which in turn yields a
first-order control barrier function (CBF) embedded within a quadratic program
(QP). By exploiting the analytic geometry of splats, our formulation provides a
continuous, closed-form representation of collision constraints that is both
simple and computationally efficient. Unlike distance-based CBFs, which tend to
activate reactively only when an obstacle is already close, our collision-cone
CBF activates proactively, allowing the robot to adjust earlier and thereby
produce smoother and safer avoidance maneuvers at lower computational cost. We
validate the method on a large synthetic scene with approximately 170k splats,
where our filter reduces planning time by a factor of 3 and significantly
decreased trajectory jerk compared to a state-of-the-art 3DGS planner, while
maintaining the same level of safety. The approach is entirely analytic,
requires no high-order CBF extensions (HOCBFs), and generalizes naturally to
robots with physical extent through a principled Minkowski-sum inflation of the
splats. These properties make the method broadly applicable to real-time
navigation in cluttered, perception-derived extreme environments, including
space robotics and satellite systems.

Motivation: 解决多智能体强化学习在竞争性环境中同时适应导致训练不稳定、非动能对抗措施在不利条件下失效、以及策略在不同智能体数量环境下泛化能力差的问题

Method: 提出Local-Canonicalization Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (LEGO)框架，集成图神经网络捕捉置换等变性和智能体数量泛化，使用规范化实现E(n)-等变性，采用异质表示编码角色特定归纳偏置

Result: 在合作和竞争群体基准测试中优于强基线并提升泛化能力，在真实世界实验中展示了对不同团队规模和智能体故障的鲁棒性

Conclusion: LEGO框架有效解决了MARL中的关键挑战，为复杂决策环境中的智能体协调提供了稳定、鲁棒且可泛化的解决方案

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm
for coordinating swarms of agents in complex decision-making, yet major
challenges remain. In competitive settings such as pursuer-evader tasks,
simultaneous adaptation can destabilize training; non-kinetic countermeasures
often fail under adverse conditions; and policies trained in one configuration
rarely generalize to environments with a different number of agents. To address
these issues, we propose the Local-Canonicalization Equivariant Graph Neural
Networks (LEGO) framework, which integrates seamlessly with popular MARL
algorithms such as MAPPO. LEGO employs graph neural networks to capture
permutation equivariance and generalization to different agent numbers,
canonicalization to enforce E(n)-equivariance, and heterogeneous
representations to encode role-specific inductive biases. Experiments on
cooperative and competitive swarm benchmarks show that LEGO outperforms strong
baselines and improves generalization. In real-world experiments, LEGO
demonstrates robustness to varying team sizes and agent failure.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在现实监督控制场景中，监控往往是间歇性而非连续的，智能体需要在这种环境下既实现自身目标又保持表面合规，这需要理解监督者的期望和信念。

Method: 利用心理理论建模监督者的期望，从中提取一个标量指标——预期偏差证据，将其作为状态依赖权重注入到KL正则化的策略改进步骤中，实现在线强化学习。

Result: 在海洋(ASV)和空中(UAV)导航的真实硬件实验中，该方法能够在线运行，实现高回报和成功率，同时观察轨迹证据与监督者期望相校准。

Conclusion: 心理理论可以有效地指导在线强化学习实现欺骗性行为，通过单一标量指标平滑权衡自身利益与合规性，避免了手工或启发式策略的设计。

Abstract: In supervisory control settings, autonomous systems are not monitored
continuously. Instead, monitoring often occurs at sporadic intervals within
known bounds. We study the problem of deception, where an agent pursues a
private objective while remaining plausibly compliant with a supervisor's
reference policy when observations occur. Motivated by the behavior of real,
human supervisors, we situate the problem within Theory of Mind: the
representation of what an observer believes and expects to see. We show that
Theory of Mind can be repurposed to steer online reinforcement learning (RL)
toward such deceptive behavior. We model the supervisor's expectations and
distill from them a single, calibrated scalar -- the expected evidence of
deviation if an observation were to happen now. This scalar combines how unlike
the reference and current action distributions appear, with the agent's belief
that an observation is imminent. Injected as a state-dependent weight into a
KL-regularized policy improvement step within an online RL loop, this scalar
informs a closed-form update that smoothly trades off self-interest and
compliance, thus sidestepping hand-crafted or heuristic policies. In
real-world, real-time hardware experiments on marine (ASV) and aerial (UAV)
navigation, our ToM-guided RL runs online, achieves high return and success
with observed-trace evidence calibrated to the supervisor's expectations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类能够自然地在抽象层面进行推理，而机器人中的抽象通常需要人工设计，限制了可扩展性和实际应用。从视觉数据自动发现有用抽象可以使规划框架更具可扩展性，更适用于真实机器人领域。

Method: 结合结构约束和注意力引导的视觉距离，利用重排问题固有的二分图结构，将结构约束和视觉嵌入整合到统一框架中，从纯视觉数据自主发现抽象。

Result: 在模拟环境中的两个重排任务上评估，方法能够一致地识别出有意义的抽象，促进有效规划，并优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法能够从视觉数据自动发现有用的抽象表示，支持高层规划，在重排任务中表现出色，为机器人自主抽象学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Learning abstractions directly from data is a core challenge in robotics.
Humans naturally operate at an abstract level, reasoning over high-level
subgoals while delegating execution to low-level motor skills -- an ability
that enables efficient problem solving in complex environments. In robotics,
abstractions and hierarchical reasoning have long been central to planning, yet
they are typically hand-engineered, demanding significant human effort and
limiting scalability. Automating the discovery of useful abstractions directly
from visual data would make planning frameworks more scalable and more
applicable to real-world robotic domains. In this work, we focus on
rearrangement tasks where the state is represented with raw images, and propose
a method to induce discrete, graph-structured abstractions by combining
structural constraints with an attention-guided visual distance. Our approach
leverages the inherent bipartite structure of rearrangement problems,
integrating structural constraints and visual embeddings into a unified
framework. This enables the autonomous discovery of abstractions from vision
alone, which can subsequently support high-level planning. We evaluate our
method on two rearrangement tasks in simulation and show that it consistently
identifies meaningful abstractions that facilitate effective planning and
outperform existing approaches.

Conclusion: 机器学习是从触觉图像中提取信息的有效技术，能够增强软体机器人对环境理解和交互的能力，具有广阔的应用前景。

Abstract: Recent advances in soft robotic hands and tactile sensing have enabled both
to perform an increasing number of complex tasks with the aid of machine
learning. In particular, we presented the GelSight Baby Fin Ray in our previous
work, which integrates a camera with a soft, compliant Fin Ray structure.
Camera-based tactile sensing gives the GelSight Baby Fin Ray the ability to
capture rich contact information like forces, object geometries, and textures.
Moreover, our previous work showed that the GelSight Baby Fin Ray can dig
through clutter, and classify in-shell nuts. To further examine the potential
of the GelSight Baby Fin Ray, we leverage learning to distinguish nut-in-shell
textures and to perform force and position estimation. We implement ablation
studies with popular neural network structures, including ResNet50, GoogLeNet,
and 3- and 5-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) structures. We conclude
that machine learning is a promising technique to extract useful information
from high-resolution tactile images and empower soft robotics to better
understand and interact with the environments.

Conclusion: Event-LAB为研究社区提供了公平比较方法的能力，通过一致的参数设置简化了多条件实验的工作流程。

Abstract: Event-based localization research and datasets are a rapidly growing area of
interest, with a tenfold increase in the cumulative total number of published
papers on this topic over the past 10 years. Whilst the rapid expansion in the
field is exciting, it brings with it an associated challenge: a growth in the
variety of required code and package dependencies as well as data formats,
making comparisons difficult and cumbersome for researchers to implement
reliably. To address this challenge, we present Event-LAB: a new and unified
framework for running several event-based localization methodologies across
multiple datasets. Event-LAB is implemented using the Pixi package and
dependency manager, that enables a single command-line installation and
invocation for combinations of localization methods and datasets. To
demonstrate the capabilities of the framework, we implement two common
event-based localization pipelines: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) and
Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). We demonstrate the ability of the
framework to systematically visualize and analyze the results of multiple
methods and datasets, revealing key insights such as the association of
parameters that control event collection counts and window sizes for frame
generation to large variations in performance. The results and analysis
demonstrate the importance of fairly comparing methodologies with consistent
event image generation parameters. Our Event-LAB framework provides this
ability for the research community, by contributing a streamlined workflow for
easily setting up multiple conditions.

TL;DR: 基于人类示范学习的草莓采摘机器人系统，通过修改的ACT算法有效解决了遮捏草莓的精细操作挑战


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 草莓自然生长在聚集状态中，常被叶片、茎条等遮捏，传统机器人系统难以精确操作采摘

Method: 使用4-DoF SCARA机械臂配合人类远程操纵界面收集数据，采用终点位置辅助的动作切块Transformer(ACT)算法学习细粒度视觉运动控制策略

Result: 在各种遮捏场景下的实验表明，修改后的方法显著超过了直接实施ACT的性能

Conclusion: 该系统通过人类示范学习有效解决了遮捏草莓的精细采摘问题，具有实际应用潜力

Abstract: Strawberries naturally grow in clusters, interwoven with leaves, stems, and
other fruits, which frequently leads to occlusion. This inherent growth habit
presents a significant challenge for robotic picking, as traditional
percept-plan-control systems struggle to reach fruits amid the clutter.
Effectively picking an occluded strawberry demands dexterous manipulation to
carefully bypass or gently move the surrounding soft objects and precisely
access the ideal picking point located at the stem just above the calyx. To
address this challenge, we introduce a strawberry-picking robotic system that
learns from human demonstrations. Our system features a 4-DoF SCARA arm paired
with a human teleoperation interface for efficient data collection and
leverages an End Pose Assisted Action Chunking Transformer (ACT) to develop a
fine-grained visuomotor picking policy. Experiments under various occlusion
scenarios demonstrate that our modified approach significantly outperforms the
direct implementation of ACT, underscoring its potential for practical
application in occluded strawberry picking.

Result: 规划时间减少80.4%，路径点减少89.4%，并在物理实验中成功完成了完整的振动筛分机操作流程

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了复杂实验室自动化中的操作挑战，具有实际应用价值

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of automating vibratory sieve shaker
operations in a materials laboratory, focusing on three critical tasks: 1)
dual-arm lid manipulation in 3 cm clearance spaces, 2) bimanual handover in
overlapping workspaces, and 3) obstructed powder sample container delivery with
orientation constraints. These tasks present significant challenges, including
inefficient sampling in narrow passages, the need for smooth trajectories to
prevent spillage, and suboptimal paths generated by conventional methods. To
overcome these challenges, we propose a hierarchical planning framework
combining Prior-Guided Path Planning and Multi-Step Trajectory Optimization.
The former uses a finite Gaussian mixture model to improve sampling efficiency
in narrow passages, while the latter refines paths by shortening, simplifying,
imposing joint constraints, and B-spline smoothing. Experimental results
demonstrate the framework's effectiveness: planning time is reduced by up to
80.4%, and waypoints are decreased by 89.4%. Furthermore, the system completes
the full vibratory sieve shaker operation workflow in a physical experiment,
validating its practical applicability for complex laboratory automation.

Abstract: Curated datasets are essential for training and evaluating AI approaches, but
are often lacking in domains where language and physical action are deeply
intertwined. In particular, few datasets capture how people acquire embodied
skills through verbal instruction over time. To address this gap, we introduce
SimCoachCorpus: a unique dataset of race car simulator driving that allows for
the investigation of rich interactive phenomena during guided and unguided
motor skill acquisition. In this dataset, 29 humans were asked to drive in a
simulator around a race track for approximately ninety minutes. Fifteen
participants were given personalized one-on-one instruction from a professional
performance driving coach, and 14 participants drove without coaching. \name\
includes embodied features such as vehicle state and inputs, map (track
boundaries and raceline), and cone landmarks. These are synchronized with
concurrent verbal coaching from a professional coach and additional feedback at
the end of each lap. We further provide annotations of coaching categories for
each concurrent feedback utterance, ratings on students' compliance with
coaching advice, and self-reported cognitive load and emotional state of
participants (gathered from surveys during the study). The dataset includes
over 20,000 concurrent feedback utterances, over 400 terminal feedback
utterances, and over 40 hours of vehicle driving data. Our naturalistic dataset
can be used for investigating motor learning dynamics, exploring linguistic
phenomena, and training computational models of teaching. We demonstrate
applications of this dataset for in-context learning, imitation learning, and
topic modeling. The dataset introduced in this work will be released publicly
upon publication of the peer-reviewed version of this paper. Researchers

Conclusion: 提出的系统集成方法通过层次优化和专门的柯色体初始化技术，成功解决了重构化机器人自动解体约束结构的复杂规划问题

Abstract: This study presents a system integration approach for planning schedules,
sequences, tasks, and motions for reconfigurable robots to automatically
disassemble constrained structures in a non-destructive manner. Such systems
must adapt their configuration and coordination to the target structure, but
the large and complex search space makes them prone to local optima. To address
this, we integrate multiple robot arms equipped with different types of tools,
together with a rotary stage, into a reconfigurable setup. This flexible system
is based on a hierarchical optimization method that generates plans meeting
multiple preferred conditions under mandatory requirements within a realistic
timeframe. The approach employs two many-objective genetic algorithms for
sequence and task planning with motion evaluations, followed by constraint
programming for scheduling. Because sequence planning has a much larger search
space, we introduce a chromosome initialization method tailored to constrained
structures to mitigate the risk of local optima. Simulation results demonstrate
that the proposed method effectively solves complex problems in reconfigurable
robotic disassembly.

Abstract: Vision-language-action policies learn manipulation skills across tasks,
environments and embodiments through large-scale pre-training. However, their
ability to generalize to novel robot configurations remains limited. Most
approaches emphasize model size, dataset scale and diversity while paying less
attention to the design of action spaces. This leads to the configuration
generalization problem, which requires costly adaptation. We address this
challenge by formulating cross-embodiment pre-training as designing policies
equivariant to embodiment configuration transformations. Building on this
principle, we propose a framework that (i) establishes a embodiment
equivariance theory for action space and policy design, (ii) introduces an
action decoder that enforces configuration equivariance, and (iii) incorporates
a geometry-aware network architecture to enhance embodiment-agnostic spatial
reasoning. Extensive experiments in both simulation and real-world settings
demonstrate that our approach improves pre-training effectiveness and enables
efficient fine-tuning on novel robot embodiments. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: BEV-ODOM2是一个改进的鸟瞰图视觉里程计框架，通过密集BEV光流监督和PV-BEV融合技术，解决了现有BEV方法监督信号稀疏和信息丢失的问题，在多个数据集上实现了40%的相对轨迹误差提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Bird's-Eye-View方法在单目视觉里程计中存在监督信号稀疏和透视到BEV投影过程中的信息丢失问题，需要在不增加额外标注的情况下解决这些局限性。

Method: 提出密集BEV光流监督（从3-DoF位姿真值构建）和PV-BEV融合（在投影前计算相关体积以保持6-DoF运动线索），采用三级监督机制和增强的旋转采样策略。

Result: 在KITTI、NCLT、Oxford和新收集的ZJH-VO多尺度数据集上实现了最先进的性能，相对轨迹误差比之前的BEV方法提升了40%。

Conclusion: BEV-ODOM2框架有效解决了BEV方法的监督稀疏和信息丢失问题，显著提升了单目视觉里程计的性能，并发布了涵盖多种地面车辆场景的ZJH-VO数据集促进未来研究。

Abstract: Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) representation offers a metric-scaled planar workspace,
facilitating the simplification of 6-DoF ego-motion to a more robust 3-DoF
model for monocular visual odometry (MVO) in intelligent transportation
systems. However, existing BEV methods suffer from sparse supervision signals
and information loss during perspective-to-BEV projection. We present
BEV-ODOM2, an enhanced framework addressing both limitations without additional
annotations. Our approach introduces: (1) dense BEV optical flow supervision
constructed from 3-DoF pose ground truth for pixel-level guidance; (2) PV-BEV
fusion that computes correlation volumes before projection to preserve 6-DoF
motion cues while maintaining scale consistency. The framework employs three
supervision levels derived solely from pose data: dense BEV flow, 5-DoF for the
PV branch, and final 3-DoF output. Enhanced rotation sampling further balances
diverse motion patterns in training. Extensive evaluation on KITTI, NCLT,
Oxford, and our newly collected ZJH-VO multi-scale dataset demonstrates
state-of-the-art performance, achieving 40 improvement in RTE compared to
previous BEV methods. The ZJH-VO dataset, covering diverse ground vehicle
scenarios from underground parking to outdoor plazas, is publicly available to
facilitate future research.

Motivation: 密集3D卷积虽然准确但计算成本高，不适合实时机器人系统。现有三平面方法依赖于2D图像特征、插值和隐式MLP，计算重。

Method: 提出无插值三平面提取和体积融合框架，将3D像素直接投影到平面特征，通过广播和求和重建特征体积，将非线性移到2D卷积。添加低分辨率体积分支获取全局上下文。

Result: 在分类和补全任务中保持或提高准确度，在分割和检测任务中以轻微准确度下降换取显著计算节省。NVIDIA Jetson Orin nano上实现稳健的实时速率。

Conclusion: 该方法通过效率优化的设计，在保持高准确性的同时实现了嵌入式系统的实时3D感知能力，适合实时机器人应用。

Abstract: Dense 3D convolutions provide high accuracy for perception but are too
computationally expensive for real-time robotic systems. Existing tri-plane
methods rely on 2D image features with interpolation, point-wise queries, and
implicit MLPs, which makes them computationally heavy and unsuitable for
embedded 3D inference. As an alternative, we propose a novel interpolation-free
tri-plane lifting and volumetric fusion framework, that directly projects 3D
voxels into plane features and reconstructs a feature volume through broadcast
and summation. This shifts nonlinearity to 2D convolutions, reducing complexity
while remaining fully parallelizable. To capture global context, we add a
low-resolution volumetric branch fused with the lifted features through a
lightweight integration layer, yielding a design that is both efficient and
end-to-end GPU-accelerated. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed
method, we conduct experiments on classification, completion, segmentation, and
detection, and we map the trade-off between efficiency and accuracy across
tasks. Results show that classification and completion retain or improve
accuracy, while segmentation and detection trade modest drops in accuracy for
significant computational savings. On-device benchmarks on an NVIDIA Jetson
Orin nano confirm robust real-time throughput, demonstrating the suitability of
the approach for embedded robotic perception.

Abstract: The emerging field of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) for humanoid robots faces
several fundamental challenges, including the high cost of data acquisition,
the lack of a standardized benchmark, and the significant gap between
simulation and the real world. To overcome these obstacles, we propose
RealMirror, a comprehensive, open-source embodied AI VLA platform. RealMirror
builds an efficient, low-cost data collection, model training, and inference
system that enables end-to-end VLA research without requiring a real robot. To
facilitate model evolution and fair comparison, we also introduce a dedicated
VLA benchmark for humanoid robots, featuring multiple scenarios, extensive
trajectories, and various VLA models. Furthermore, by integrating generative
models and 3D Gaussian Splatting to reconstruct realistic environments and
robot models, we successfully demonstrate zero-shot Sim2Real transfer, where
models trained exclusively on simulation data can perform tasks on a real robot
seamlessly, without any fine-tuning. In conclusion, with the unification of
these critical components, RealMirror provides a robust framework that
significantly accelerates the development of VLA models for humanoid robots.

Method: 进行局部分析，计算运动学切线圆锥，并构建配置空间的局部近似模型，以支持高阶局部分析

Result: 证明该连杆机构的配置空间在局部是光滑流形，参考配置不是配置空间奇异点，微分自由度在局部是常数，这使得该机构成为摇动连杆机构

Conclusion: 该三环空间连杆机构是一种过约束但参考配置不是奇异点的摇动机构，其微分自由度为5而有限自由度为3，高阶局部分析方法有助于理解这种复杂的连杆机构特性

Abstract: This paper revisits a three-loop spatial linkage that was proposed in an ARK
2004 paper by Karl Wohlhart (as extension of a two-loop linkage proposed by
Eddie Baker in 1980) and later analyzed in an ARK 2006 paper by Diez-Martinez
et. al. A local analysis shows that this linkage has a finite degree of freedom
(DOF) 3 (and is thus overconstrained) while in its reference configuration the
differential DOF is 5. It is shown that its configuration space is locally a
smooth manifold so that the reference configuration is not a c-space
singularity. It is shown that the differential DOF is locally constant, which
makes this linkage shaky (so that the reference configuration is not a
singularity). The higher-order local analysis is facilitated by the computation
of the kinematic tangent cone as well as a local approximation of the c-space.

Conclusion: 无参考的MPPI方法能够有效优化门进度目标，为无人机竞速提供了新的控制器设计思路，展示了采样优化方法在处理复杂目标函数方面的优势。

Abstract: While model-based controllers have demonstrated remarkable performance in
autonomous drone racing, their performance is often constrained by the reliance
on pre-computed reference trajectories. Conventional approaches, such as
trajectory tracking, demand a dynamically feasible, full-state reference,
whereas contouring control relaxes this requirement to a geometric path but
still necessitates a reference. Recent advancements in reinforcement learning
(RL) have revealed that many model-based controllers optimize surrogate
objectives, such as trajectory tracking, rather than the primary racing goal of
directly maximizing progress through gates. Inspired by these findings, this
work introduces a reference-free method for time-optimal racing by
incorporating this gate progress objective, derived from RL reward shaping,
directly into the Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) formulation. The
sampling-based nature of MPPI makes it uniquely capable of optimizing the
discontinuous and non-differentiable objective in real-time. We also establish
a unified framework that leverages MPPI to systematically and fairly compare
three distinct objective functions with a consistent dynamics model and
parameter set: classical trajectory tracking, contouring control, and the
proposed gate progress objective. We compare the performance of these three
objectives when solved via both MPPI and a traditional gradient-based solver.
Our results demonstrate that the proposed reference-free approach achieves
competitive racing performance, rivaling or exceeding reference-based methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在人机共享工作空间中，有效沟通对安全和效率至关重要。本文通过研究非语言沟通对人机交互的影响，以提升协作效果和安全性。

Method: 使用Franka Emika Panda机器人，在末端执行器上安装LED灯带，并通过平板显示动态面部表情。进行了包括三种条件的实验：LED信号单独、LED信号结合反应式情感显示、LED信号结合预先情感显示。通过问卷调查和位置跟踪收集数据，评估碰撞预期、沟通清晰度和任务性能。

Result: 结果显示，虽然情感显示增加了机器人的互动性感知，但与单独使用LED信号相比，并没有显著提高碰撞预期、沟通清晰度或任务效率。

Conclusion: 情感细节虽能增强用户参与感，但在共享工作空间中对任务性能的影响有限，LED信号单独已能提供有效的沟通方式。

Abstract: Effective communication is essential for safety and efficiency in human-robot
collaboration, particularly in shared workspaces. This paper investigates the
impact of nonverbal communication on human-robot interaction (HRI) by
integrating reactive light signals and emotional displays into a robotic
system. We equipped a Franka Emika Panda robot with an LED strip on its end
effector and an animated facial display on a tablet to convey movement intent
through colour-coded signals and facial expressions. We conducted a human-robot
collaboration experiment with 18 participants, evaluating three conditions: LED
signals alone, LED signals with reactive emotional displays, and LED signals
with pre-emptive emotional displays. We collected data through questionnaires
and position tracking to assess anticipation of potential collisions, perceived
clarity of communication, and task performance. The results indicate that while
emotional displays increased the perceived interactivity of the robot, they did
not significantly improve collision anticipation, communication clarity, or
task efficiency compared to LED signals alone. These findings suggest that
while emotional cues can enhance user engagement, their impact on task
performance in shared workspaces is limited.

Abstract: Ensuring safety of vision-based control systems remains a major challenge
hindering their deployment in critical settings. Safety filters have gained
increased interest as effective tools for ensuring the safety of classical
control systems, but their applications in vision-based control settings have
so far been limited. Pre-trained vision models (PVRs) have been shown to be
effective perception backbones for control in various robotics domains. In this
paper, we are interested in examining their effectiveness when used for
designing vision-based safety filters. We use them as backbones for classifiers
defining failure sets, for Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability-based safety
filters, and for latent world models. We discuss the trade-offs between
training from scratch, fine-tuning, and freezing the PVRs when training the
models they are backbones for. We also evaluate whether one of the PVRs is
superior across all tasks, evaluate whether learned world models or Q-functions
are better for switching decisions to safe policies, and discuss practical
considerations for deploying these PVRs on resource-constrained devices.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: COMPASS是一个多阶段探索和操作框架，用于受限杂乱环境中的机器人操作，通过操作感知的采样规划器和多目标效用函数提高操作成功率24.25%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受限和杂乱环境中的操作面临部分可观测性和复杂配置空间的挑战，需要智能探索策略来安全理解场景并搜索目标。

Method: 提出多阶段探索操作框架，包括近场感知扫描构建局部碰撞地图、多目标效用函数选择信息丰富且利于后续操作的视点、约束操作优化策略生成尊重障碍物约束的操作姿态。

Result: 在仿真中相比仅考虑信息增益的探索方法，操作成功率提高24.25%；真实世界实验证明方法在受限环境中主动感知和操作的能力。

Conclusion: COMPASS框架有效解决了受限杂乱环境中的操作挑战，通过系统化的探索和优化策略显著提升了操作性能。

Abstract: Manipulation in confined and cluttered environments remains a significant
challenge due to partial observability and complex configuration spaces.
Effective manipulation in such environments requires an intelligent exploration
strategy to safely understand the scene and search the target. In this paper,
we propose COMPASS, a multi-stage exploration and manipulation framework
featuring a manipulation-aware sampling-based planner. First, we reduce
collision risks with a near-field awareness scan to build a local collision
map. Additionally, we employ a multi-objective utility function to find
viewpoints that are both informative and conducive to subsequent manipulation.
Moreover, we perform a constrained manipulation optimization strategy to
generate manipulation poses that respect obstacle constraints. To
systematically evaluate method's performance under these difficulties, we
propose a benchmark of confined-space exploration and manipulation containing
four level challenging scenarios. Compared to exploration methods designed for
other robots and only considering information gain, our framework increases
manipulation success rate by 24.25% in simulations. Real-world experiments
demonstrate our method's capability for active sensing and manipulation in
confined environments.

*Humphrey Munn,Brendan Tidd,Peter Böhm,Marcus Gallagher,David Howard*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: GCR-PPO是一种改进的强化学习算法，通过多目标梯度冲突解决机制，在机器人控制任务中比传统PPO平均提升9.5%性能，特别是在目标冲突严重的任务中表现更佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习将多个任务目标聚合成单一标量奖励，导致需要精细的奖励调优、容易陷入局部最优，且随着目标数量增加，调优成本和次优性问题更加严重。多目标方法在机器人RL中应用较少，主要因为计算成本和优化难度。

Method: 提出GCR-PPO算法，修改actor-critic优化过程：使用多头critic分解actor更新为目标梯度，基于目标优先级解决梯度冲突。在IsaacLab操作和运动基准测试以及多目标修改任务上进行评估。

Result: 相比并行PPO具有更好的可扩展性(p=0.04)，无显著计算开销。在冲突严重的任务中性能更高，平均改进9.5%，高冲突任务改进更大。

Conclusion: GCR-PPO通过显式处理多目标梯度冲突，有效解决了传统标量化方法的局限性，为机器人强化学习中的多目标优化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) robot controllers usually aggregate many task
objectives into one scalar reward. While large-scale proximal policy
optimisation (PPO) has enabled impressive results such as robust robot
locomotion in the real world, many tasks still require careful reward tuning
and are brittle to local optima. Tuning cost and sub-optimality grow with the
number of objectives, limiting scalability. Modelling reward vectors and their
trade-offs can address these issues; however, multi-objective methods remain
underused in RL for robotics because of computational cost and optimisation
difficulty. In this work, we investigate the conflict between gradient
contributions for each objective that emerge from scalarising the task
objectives. In particular, we explicitly address the conflict between
task-based rewards and terms that regularise the policy towards realistic
behaviour. We propose GCR-PPO, a modification to actor-critic optimisation that
decomposes the actor update into objective-wise gradients using a multi-headed
critic and resolves conflicts based on the objective priority. Our methodology,
GCR-PPO, is evaluated on the well-known IsaacLab manipulation and locomotion
benchmarks and additional multi-objective modifications on two related tasks.
We show superior scalability compared to parallel PPO (p = 0.04), without
significant computational overhead. We also show higher performance with more
conflicting tasks. GCR-PPO improves on large-scale PPO with an average
improvement of 9.5%, with high-conflict tasks observing a greater improvement.

Motivation: 解决现有视觉-语言-动作(VLA)系统的关键限制，包括领域过拟合、推理不可解释性以及辅助生成模型的高延迟问题，推动VLA从黑盒控制器向真正能够与人类协作的辅助智能体发展。

Method: 采用混合专家设计，整合基于VLM的反思推理和基于扩散的动作生成，通过两阶段训练方法（动作基础和反思调优）实现显式自我反思，并在遇到不确定性或重复失败时主动寻求人类指导。

Result: 相比生成式智能体，将标准化时间减少约2倍，Dream计数减少约4倍，实现了更高的成功率、改进的可解释性以及平衡的低延迟性能。

Conclusion: 这项工作在将VLA从黑盒控制器转变为真正能够推理、行动并与人类协作的辅助智能体方面迈出了开创性的一步。

Abstract: In this work, we present CollabVLA, a self-reflective vision-language-action
framework that transforms a standard visuomotor policy into a collaborative
assistant. CollabVLA tackles key limitations of prior VLAs, including domain
overfitting, non-interpretable reasoning, and the high latency of auxiliary
generative models, by integrating VLM-based reflective reasoning with
diffusion-based action generation under a mixture-of-experts design. Through a
two-stage training recipe of action grounding and reflection tuning, it
supports explicit self-reflection and proactively solicits human guidance when
confronted with uncertainty or repeated failure. It cuts normalized Time by ~2x
and Dream counts by ~4x vs. generative agents, achieving higher success rates,
improved interpretability, and balanced low latency compared with existing
methods. This work takes a pioneering step toward shifting VLAs from opaque
controllers to genuinely assistive agents capable of reasoning, acting, and
collaborating with humans.

TL;DR: PERAL框架通过球形机器人的内部差速驱动实现被动LiDAR激励，无需额外硬件即可增强垂直扫描多样性，提高地图完整性和导航精度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决水平安装LiDAR在近地面区域扫描点云稀疏的问题，避免传统方案（静态倾斜、主动旋转或高密度传感器）带来的水平感知损失、额外执行器、成本和功耗增加

Method: 建立内部差速驱动与传感器姿态的耦合模型，在名义目标跟踪命令上叠加有界非周期性振荡，实现被动LiDAR激励

Result: 在实验室、走廊和战术环境中验证，实现高达96%的地图完整性，轨迹跟踪误差减少27%，鲁棒的近地面人体检测，相比基线方案重量、功耗和成本更低

Conclusion: PERAL框架为球形机器人提供了一种无需专用硬件的感知增强解决方案，在保持导航精度的同时显著改善了LiDAR的垂直扫描性能

Abstract: Autonomous mobile robots increasingly rely on LiDAR-IMU odometry for
navigation and mapping, yet horizontally mounted LiDARs such as the MID360
capture few near-ground returns, limiting terrain awareness and degrading
performance in feature-scarce environments. Prior solutions - static tilt,
active rotation, or high-density sensors - either sacrifice horizontal
perception or incur added actuators, cost, and power. We introduce PERAL, a
perception-aware motion control framework for spherical robots that achieves
passive LiDAR excitation without dedicated hardware. By modeling the coupling
between internal differential-drive actuation and sensor attitude, PERAL
superimposes bounded, non-periodic oscillations onto nominal goal- or
trajectory-tracking commands, enriching vertical scan diversity while
preserving navigation accuracy. Implemented on a compact spherical robot, PERAL
is validated across laboratory, corridor, and tactical environments.
Experiments demonstrate up to 96 percent map completeness, a 27 percent
reduction in trajectory tracking error, and robust near-ground human detection,
all at lower weight, power, and cost compared with static tilt, active
rotation, and fixed horizontal baselines. The design and code will be
open-sourced upon acceptance.

Conclusion: RCS成功填补了机器人学习研究中的工具链空白，为大规模通用策略研究提供了高效、统一的开发环境，促进了仿真到真实世界的无缝转换

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) mark a major shift in robot learning.
They replace specialized architectures and task-tailored components of expert
policies with large-scale data collection and setup-specific fine-tuning. In
this machine learning-focused workflow that is centered around models and
scalable training, traditional robotics software frameworks become a
bottleneck, while robot simulations offer only limited support for
transitioning from and to real-world experiments. In this work, we close this
gap by introducing Robot Control Stack (RCS), a lean ecosystem designed from
the ground up to support research in robot learning with large-scale generalist
policies. At its core, RCS features a modular and easily extensible layered
architecture with a unified interface for simulated and physical robots,
facilitating sim-to-real transfer. Despite its minimal footprint and
dependencies, it offers a complete feature set, enabling both real-world
experiments and large-scale training in simulation. Our contribution is
twofold: First, we introduce the architecture of RCS and explain its design
principles. Second, we evaluate its usability and performance along the
development cycle of VLA and RL policies. Our experiments also provide an
extensive evaluation of Octo, OpenVLA, and Pi Zero on multiple robots and shed
light on how simulation data can improve real-world policy performance. Our

Abstract: This paper presents a CAD-driven co-design framework for optimizing
jet-powered aerial humanoid robots to execute dynamically constrained
trajectories. Starting from the iRonCub-Mk3 model, a Design of Experiments
(DoE) approach is used to generate 5,000 geometrically varied and mechanically
feasible designs by modifying limb dimensions, jet interface geometry (e.g.,
angle and offset), and overall mass distribution. Each model is constructed
through CAD assemblies to ensure structural validity and compatibility with
simulation tools. To reduce computational cost and enable parameter sensitivity
analysis, the models are clustered using K-means, with representative centroids
selected for evaluation. A minimum-jerk trajectory is used to assess flight
performance, providing position and velocity references for a momentum-based
linearized Model Predictive Control (MPC) strategy. A multi-objective
optimization is then conducted using the NSGA-II algorithm, jointly exploring
the space of design centroids and MPC gain parameters. The objectives are to
minimize trajectory tracking error and mechanical energy expenditure. The
framework outputs a set of flight-ready humanoid configurations with validated
control parameters, offering a structured method for selecting and implementing
feasible aerial humanoid designs.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in dexterous manipulations, the manipulation of
articulated objects and generalization across different categories remain
significant challenges. To address these issues, we introduce DART, a novel
framework that enhances a diffusion-based policy with affordance learning and
linear temporal logic (LTL) representations to improve the learning efficiency
and generalizability of articulated dexterous manipulation. Specifically, DART
leverages LTL to understand task semantics and affordance learning to identify
optimal interaction points. The {diffusion-based policy} then generalizes these
interactions across various categories. Additionally, we exploit an
optimization method based on interaction data to refine actions, overcoming the
limitations of traditional diffusion policies that typically rely on offline
reinforcement learning or learning from demonstrations. Experimental results
demonstrate that DART outperforms most existing methods in manipulation
ability, generalization performance, transfer reasoning, and robustness. For

Conclusion: Multi-CAP算法通过连通性知的层次结构和全局优化，有效解决了多机器人在未知环境中的覆盖协调问题，为大规模多机器人系统提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Efficient coordination of multiple robots for coverage of large, unknown
environments is a significant challenge that involves minimizing the total
coverage path length while reducing inter-robot conflicts. In this paper, we
introduce a Multi-robot Connectivity-Aware Planner (Multi-CAP), a hierarchical
coverage path planning algorithm that facilitates multi-robot coordination
through a novel connectivity-aware approach. The algorithm constructs and
dynamically maintains an adjacency graph that represents the environment as a
set of connected subareas. Critically, we make the assumption that the
environment, while unknown, is bounded. This allows for incremental refinement
of the adjacency graph online to ensure its structure represents the physical
layout of the space, both in observed and unobserved areas of the map as robots
explore the environment. We frame the task of assigning subareas to robots as a
Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), a well-studied problem for finding optimal
routes for a fleet of vehicles. This is used to compute disjoint tours that
minimize redundant travel, assigning each robot a unique, non-conflicting set
of subareas. Each robot then executes its assigned tour, independently adapting
its coverage strategy within each subarea to minimize path length based on
real-time sensor observations of the subarea. We demonstrate through
simulations and multi-robot hardware experiments that Multi-CAP significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in key metrics, including coverage time,
total path length, and path overlap ratio. Ablation studies further validate
the critical role of our connectivity-aware graph and the global tour planner
in achieving these performance gains.

Abstract: Semantic SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) systems enrich robot
maps with structural and semantic information, enabling robots to operate more
effectively in complex environments. However, these systems struggle in
real-world scenarios with occlusions, incomplete data, or ambiguous geometries,
as they cannot fully leverage the higher-level spatial and semantic knowledge
humans naturally apply. We introduce HICS-SLAM, a Human-in-the-Loop semantic
SLAM framework that uses a shared extended reality environment for real-time
collaboration. The system allows human operators to directly interact with and
visualize the robot's 3D scene graph, and add high-level semantic concepts
(e.g., rooms or structural entities) into the mapping process. We propose a
graph-based semantic fusion methodology that integrates these human
interventions with robot perception, enabling scalable collaboration for
enhanced situational awareness. Experimental evaluations on real-world
construction site datasets demonstrate improvements in room detection accuracy,
map precision, and semantic completeness compared to automated baselines,
demonstrating both the effectiveness of the approach and its potential for
future extensions.

Abstract: We propose a neuromorphic tactile sensing framework for robotic texture
classification that is inspired by human exploratory strategies. Our system
utilizes the NeuroTac sensor to capture neuromorphic tactile data during a
series of exploratory motions. We first tested six distinct motions for texture
classification under fixed environment: sliding, rotating, tapping, as well as
the combined motions: sliding+rotating, tapping+rotating, and tapping+sliding.
We chose sliding and sliding+rotating as the best motions based on final
accuracy and the sample timing length needed to reach converged accuracy. In
the second experiment designed to simulate complex real-world conditions, these
two motions were further evaluated under varying contact depth and speeds.
Under these conditions, our framework attained the highest accuracy of 87.33\%
with sliding+rotating while maintaining an extremely low power consumption of
only 8.04 mW. These results suggest that the sliding+rotating motion is the
optimal exploratory strategy for neuromorphic tactile sensing deployment in
texture classification tasks and holds significant promise for enhancing
robotic environmental interaction.

Abstract: Effective human-robot collaboration in surgery is affected by the inherent
ambiguity of verbal communication. This paper presents a framework for a
robotic surgical assistant that interprets and disambiguates verbal
instructions from a surgeon by grounding them in the visual context of the
operating field. The system employs a two-level affordance-based reasoning
process that first analyzes the surgical scene using a multimodal
vision-language model and then reasons about the instruction using a knowledge
base of tool capabilities. To ensure patient safety, a dual-set conformal
prediction method is used to provide a statistically rigorous confidence
measure for robot decisions, allowing it to identify and flag ambiguous
commands. We evaluated our framework on a curated dataset of ambiguous surgical
requests from cholecystectomy videos, demonstrating a general disambiguation
rate of 60% and presenting a method for safer human-robot interaction in the
operating room.

Abstract: Quadrotor navigation in unknown environments is critical for practical
missions such as search-and-rescue. Solving it requires addressing three key
challenges: the non-convexity of free space due to obstacles,
quadrotor-specific dynamics and objectives, and the need for exploration of
unknown regions to find a path to the goal. Recently, the Model Predictive Path
Integral (MPPI) method has emerged as a promising solution that solves the
first two challenges. By leveraging sampling-based optimization, it can
effectively handle non-convex free space while directly optimizing over the
full quadrotor dynamics, enabling the inclusion of quadrotor-specific costs
such as energy consumption. However, its performance in unknown environments is
limited, as it lacks the ability to explore unknown regions when blocked by
large obstacles. To solve this issue, we introduce Perception-Aware MPPI
(PA-MPPI). Here, perception-awareness is defined as adapting the trajectory
online based on perception objectives. Specifically, when the goal is occluded,
PA-MPPI's perception cost biases trajectories that can perceive unknown
regions. This expands the mapped traversable space and increases the likelihood
of finding alternative paths to the goal. Through hardware experiments, we
demonstrate that PA-MPPI, running at 50 Hz with our efficient perception and
mapping module, performs up to 100% better than the baseline in our challenging
settings where the state-of-the-art MPPI fails. In addition, we demonstrate
that PA-MPPI can be used as a safe and robust action policy for navigation
foundation models, which often provide goal poses that are not directly
reachable.

Abstract: Mobile manipulation requires the coordinated control of a mobile base and a
robotic arm while simultaneously perceiving both global scene context and
fine-grained object details. Existing single-view approaches often fail in
unstructured environments due to limited fields of view, exploration, and
generalization abilities. Moreover, classical controllers, although stable,
struggle with efficiency and manipulability near singularities. To address
these challenges, we propose M4Diffuser, a hybrid framework that integrates a
Multi-View Diffusion Policy with a novel Reduced and Manipulability-aware QP
(ReM-QP) controller for mobile manipulation. The diffusion policy leverages
proprioceptive states and complementary camera perspectives with both
close-range object details and global scene context to generate task-relevant
end-effector goals in the world frame. These high-level goals are then executed
by the ReM-QP controller, which eliminates slack variables for computational
efficiency and incorporates manipulability-aware preferences for robustness
near singularities. Comprehensive experiments in simulation and real-world
environments show that M4Diffuser achieves 7 to 56 percent higher success rates
and reduces collisions by 3 to 31 percent over baselines. Our approach
demonstrates robust performance for smooth whole-body coordination, and strong
generalization to unseen tasks, paving the way for reliable mobile manipulation
in unstructured environments. Details of the demo and supplemental material are
available on our project website https://sites.google.com/view/m4diffuser.

Abstract: In-hand manipulation tasks, particularly in human-inspired robotic systems,
must rely on distributed tactile sensing to achieve precise control across a
wide variety of tasks. However, the optimal configuration of this network of
sensors is a complex problem, and while the fingertips are a common choice for
placing sensors, the contribution of tactile information from other regions of
the hand is often overlooked. This work investigates the impact of tactile
feedback from various regions of the fingers and palm in performing in-hand
object reorientation tasks. We analyze how sensory feedback from different
parts of the hand influences the robustness of deep reinforcement learning
control policies and investigate the relationship between object
characteristics and optimal sensor placement. We identify which tactile sensing
configurations contribute to improving the efficiency and accuracy of
manipulation. Our results provide valuable insights for the design and use of
anthropomorphic end-effectors with enhanced manipulation capabilities.

TL;DR: ExT是一个用于自主挖掘机的统一开源框架，通过大规模演示收集、预训练和微调来开发多任务挖掘策略，实现了从仿真到真实机器的成功迁移和快速适应新任务的能力。


<details>

Conclusion: ExT有潜力成为可扩展和可泛化自主挖掘的基础框架，展示了大型预训练模型在重型建筑机械领域的应用前景。

Abstract: Scaling up the deployment of autonomous excavators is of great economic and
societal importance. Yet it remains a challenging problem, as effective systems
must robustly handle unseen worksite conditions and new hardware
configurations. Current state-of-the-art approaches rely on highly engineered,
task-specific controllers, which require extensive manual tuning for each new
scenario. In contrast, recent advances in large-scale pretrained models have
shown remarkable adaptability across tasks and embodiments in domains such as
manipulation and navigation, but their applicability to heavy construction
machinery remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce ExT, a unified
open-source framework for large-scale demonstration collection, pretraining,
and fine-tuning of multitask excavation policies. ExT policies are first
trained on large-scale demonstrations collected from a mix of experts, then
fine-tuned either with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement learning
fine-tuning (RLFT) to specialize to new tasks or operating conditions. Through
both simulation and real-world experiments, we show that pretrained ExT
policies can execute complete excavation cycles with centimeter-level accuracy,
successfully transferring from simulation to real machine with performance
comparable to specialized single-task controllers. Furthermore, in simulation,
we demonstrate that ExT's fine-tuning pipelines allow rapid adaptation to new
tasks, out-of-distribution conditions, and machine configurations, while
maintaining strong performance on previously learned tasks. These results
highlight the potential of ExT to serve as a foundation for scalable and
generalizable autonomous excavation.

Abstract: Reliable, drift-free global localization presents significant challenges yet
remains crucial for autonomous navigation in large-scale dynamic environments.
In this paper, we introduce a tightly-coupled Semantic-LiDAR-Inertial-Wheel
Odometry fusion framework, which is specifically designed to provide
high-precision state estimation and robust localization in large-scale dynamic
environments. Our framework leverages an efficient semantic-voxel map
representation and employs an improved scan matching algorithm, which utilizes
global semantic information to significantly reduce long-term trajectory drift.
Furthermore, it seamlessly fuses data from LiDAR, IMU, and wheel odometry using
a tightly-coupled multi-sensor fusion Iterative Error-State Kalman Filter
(iESKF). This ensures reliable localization without experiencing abnormal
drift. Moreover, to tackle the challenges posed by terrain variations and
dynamic movements, we introduce a 3D adaptive scaling strategy that allows for
flexible adjustments to wheel odometry measurement weights, thereby enhancing
localization precision. This study presents extensive real-world experiments
conducted in a one-million-square-meter automated port, encompassing 3,575
hours of operational data from 35 Intelligent Guided Vehicles (IGVs). The
results consistently demonstrate that our system outperforms state-of-the-art
LiDAR-based localization methods in large-scale dynamic environments,
highlighting the framework's reliability and practical value.

Abstract: We propose a new formulation for the multi-robot task allocation problem that
incorporates (a) complex precedence relationships between tasks, (b) efficient
intra-task coordination, and (c) cooperation through the formation of robot
coalitions. A task graph specifies the tasks and their relationships, and a set
of reward functions models the effects of coalition size and preceding task
performance. Maximizing task rewards is NP-hard; hence, we propose network
flow-based algorithms to approximate solutions efficiently. A novel online
algorithm performs iterative re-allocation, providing robustness to task
failures and model inaccuracies to achieve higher performance than offline
approaches. We comprehensively evaluate the algorithms in a testbed with random
missions and reward functions and compare them to a mixed-integer solver and a
greedy heuristic. Additionally, we validate the overall approach in an advanced
simulator, modeling reward functions based on realistic physical phenomena and
executing the tasks with realistic robot dynamics. Results establish efficacy
in modeling complex missions and efficiency in generating high-fidelity task
plans while leveraging task relationships.

Conclusion: 该框架及训练策略为实现协作型具身智能体提供了一条可行路径

Abstract: The ultimate goal of embodied agents is to create collaborators that can
interact with humans, not mere executors that passively follow instructions.
This requires agents to communicate, coordinate, and adapt their actions based
on human feedback. Recently, advances in VLAs have offered a path toward this
goal. However, most current VLA-based embodied agents operate in a one-way
mode: they receive an instruction and execute it without feedback. This
approach fails in real-world scenarios where instructions are often ambiguous.
In this paper, we address this problem with the Ask-to-Clarify framework. Our
framework first resolves ambiguous instructions by asking questions in a
multi-turn dialogue. Then it generates low-level actions end-to-end.
Specifically, the Ask-to-Clarify framework consists of two components, one VLM
for collaboration and one diffusion for action. We also introduce a connection
module that generates conditions for the diffusion based on the output of the
VLM. This module adjusts the observation by instructions to create reliable
conditions. We train our framework with a two-stage knowledge-insulation
strategy. First, we fine-tune the collaboration component using
ambiguity-solving dialogue data to handle ambiguity. Then, we integrate the
action component while freezing the collaboration one. This preserves the
interaction abilities while fine-tuning the diffusion to generate actions. The
training strategy guarantees our framework can first ask questions, then
generate actions. During inference, a signal detector functions as a router
that helps our framework switch between asking questions and taking actions. We
evaluate the Ask-to-Clarify framework in 8 real-world tasks, where it
outperforms existing state-of-the-art VLAs. The results suggest that our
proposed framework, along with the training strategy, provides a path toward
collaborative embodied agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 未来行星探测户需要在混合能源（指数装置发电机+太阳能）下长期运行，但现有规划方法往往忽略能量约束和功率流模型。

Method: 通过将物理基础的平移、旋转和阻力功率模型与基准子系统负载相结合，并将累计能量预算和瞬时功率约束整合到SE(2)基础的多项式轨迹优化中。

Result: 在月球类似地形上的模拟显示，该方法生成的轨迹峰值功率仅超出指定限制的0.55%，而现有方法超出17%以上。

Conclusion: 该方法为长期行星任务提供了一种理论基础健全且实用的能量意识自主规划方案。

Abstract: Future planetary exploration rovers must operate for extended durations on
hybrid power inputs that combine steady radioisotope thermoelectric generator
(RTG) output with variable solar photovoltaic (PV) availability. While
energy-aware planning has been studied for aerial and underwater robots under
battery limits, few works for ground rovers explicitly model power flow or
enforce instantaneous power constraints. Classical terrain-aware planners
emphasize slope or traversability, and trajectory optimization methods
typically focus on geometric smoothness and dynamic feasibility, neglecting
energy feasibility. We present an energy-constrained trajectory planning
framework that explicitly integrates physics-based models of translational,
rotational, and resistive power with baseline subsystem loads, under hybrid
RTG-solar input. By incorporating both cumulative energy budgets and
instantaneous power constraints into SE(2)-based polynomial trajectory
optimization, the method ensures trajectories that are simultaneously smooth,
dynamically feasible, and power-compliant. Simulation results on lunar-like
terrain show that our planner generates trajectories with peak power within
0.55 percent of the prescribed limit, while existing methods exceed limits by
over 17 percent. This demonstrates a principled and practical approach to
energy-aware autonomy for long-duration planetary missions.

TL;DR: 提出了基于扩散模型的AnoF-Diff方法，用于从时间序列数据中提取力-扭矩特征并检测异常，在嘈杂数据集上表现优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的流式传感器数据通常具有噪声大、非平稳且随任务和工具变化的特点，现有多变量时间序列异常检测方法难以直接应用于强力工具使用任务

Method: 基于扩散模型提取力-扭矩特征，并提出并行异常评分评估方法，支持一步扩散的在线异常检测

Result: 在四个强力工具使用任务上，F1分数和AUROC指标均优于最先进方法，对噪声数据集更具鲁棒性

Conclusion: AnoF-Diff方法在强力工具使用场景中表现出优异的异常检测性能，特别适合处理现实世界中的噪声和非平稳数据

Abstract: Multivariate time-series anomaly detection, which is critical for identifying
unexpected events, has been explored in the field of machine learning for
several decades. However, directly applying these methods to data from forceful
tool use tasks is challenging because streaming sensor data in the real world
tends to be inherently noisy, exhibits non-stationary behavior, and varies
across different tasks and tools. To address these challenges, we propose a
method, AnoF-Diff, based on the diffusion model to extract force-torque
features from time-series data and use force-torque features to detect
anomalies. We compare our method with other state-of-the-art methods in terms
of F1-score and Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC)
on four forceful tool-use tasks, demonstrating that our method has better
performance and is more robust to a noisy dataset. We also propose the method
of parallel anomaly score evaluation based on one-step diffusion and
demonstrate how our method can be used for online anomaly detection in several
forceful tool use experiments.

Conclusion: 提出的统一建模框架有效整合了软生长机器人的多个关键方面，优化的设计对环境不确定性和制造误差具有鲁棒性，并在实际障碍物丰富的环境中成功部署。

Abstract: Soft growing robots, commonly referred to as vine robots, have demonstrated
remarkable ability to interact safely and robustly with unstructured and
dynamic environments. It is therefore natural to exploit contact with the
environment for planning and design optimization tasks. Previous research has
focused on planning under contact for passively deforming robots with
pre-formed bends. However, adding active steering to these soft growing robots
is necessary for successful navigation in more complex environments. To this
end, we develop a unified modeling framework that integrates vine robot growth,
bending, actuation, and obstacle contact. We extend the beam moment model to
include the effects of actuation on kinematics under growth and then use these
models to develop a fast parallel simulation framework. We validate our model
and simulator with real robot experiments. To showcase the capabilities of our
framework, we apply our model in a design optimization task to find designs for
vine robots navigating through cluttered environments, identifying designs that
minimize the number of required actuators by exploiting environmental contacts.
We show the robustness of the designs to environmental and manufacturing
uncertainties. Finally, we fabricate an optimized design and successfully
deploy it in an obstacle-rich environment.

Motivation: 以往研究主要关注解决现有问题，本文重点研究LLM发现新定理的能力

Method: 提出Conjecturing-Proving Loop流水线，在包含之前生成定理和证明的上下文中生成更难的定理

Result: 系统重新发现了已发表但未形式化的定理，其中至少一个定理在无上下文学习时无法证明

Conclusion: 上下文学习对神经定理证明有效，新方法能够自动发现并证明数学定理

Abstract: Large Language Models have demonstrated significant promise in formal theorem
proving. However, previous works mainly focus on solving existing problems. In
this paper, we focus on the ability of LLMs to find novel theorems. We propose
Conjecturing-Proving Loop pipeline for automatically generating mathematical
conjectures and proving them in Lean 4 format. A feature of our approach is
that we generate and prove further conjectures with context including
previously generated theorems and their proofs, which enables the generation of
more difficult proofs by in-context learning of proof strategies without
changing parameters of LLMs. We demonstrated that our framework rediscovered
theorems with verification, which were published in past mathematical papers
and have not yet formalized. Moreover, at least one of these theorems could not
be proved by the LLM without in-context learning, even in natural language,
which means that in-context learning was effective for neural theorem proving.

Motivation: 调查深度神经网络在近似非局部守恒律解时的效率，评估网络架构选择对解准确性和计算时间的影响

Method: 通过系统实验测试不同网络配置参数（激活函数选择、网络深度、宽度、训练方法）的影响，并与传统数值方法进行比较分析

Result: tanh激活函数在各配置下都能稳定收敛，正弦激活在个别情况下可以获得更低错误和更短训练时间，但有时会产生非物理效应；最佳配置的DNNs具有竞争力的准确性，但标准前缀网络在处理奇异或分段常数解时存在本质限制

Conclusion: 该研究为实践者提供了DNN实施的经验指南，同时揭示了标准激活函数自然函数空间限制导致的基础理论约束，这些约束必须克服才能扩大神经网络在具有不连续性的更复杂物理系统中的应用性

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the efficiency of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs)
to approximate the solution of a nonlocal conservation law derived from the
identical-oscillator Kuramoto model, focusing on the evaluation of an
architectural choice and its impact on solution accuracy based on the energy
norm and computation time. Through systematic experimentation, we demonstrate
that network configuration parameters-specifically, activation function
selection (tanh vs. sin vs. ReLU), network depth (4-8 hidden layers), width
(64-256 neurons), and training methodology (collocation points, epoch
count)-significantly influence convergence characteristics. We observe that
tanh activation yields stable convergence across configurations, whereas sine
activation can attain marginally lower errors and training times in isolated
cases, but occasionally produce nonphysical artefacts. Our comparative analysis
with traditional numerical methods shows that optimally configured DNNs offer
competitive accuracy with notably different computational trade-offs.
Furthermore, we identify fundamental limitations of standard feed-forward
architectures when handling singular or piecewise-constant solutions, providing
empirical evidence that such networks inherently oversmooth sharp features due
to the natural function space limitations of standard activation functions.
This work contributes to the growing body of research on neural network-based
scientific computing by providing practitioners with empirical guidelines for
DNN implementation while illuminating fundamental theoretical constraints that
must be overcome to expand their applicability to more challenging physical
systems with discontinuities.

*Arjun S. Nair,Kristina P. Sinaga*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We prove a fundamental impossibility theorem: neural networks cannot
simultaneously learn well-calibrated confidence estimates with meaningful
diversity when trained using binary correct/incorrect supervision. Through
rigorous mathematical analysis and comprehensive empirical evaluation spanning
negative reward training, symmetric loss functions, and post-hoc calibration
methods, we demonstrate this is an information-theoretic constraint, not a
methodological failure. Our experiments reveal universal failure patterns:
negative rewards produce extreme underconfidence (ECE greater than 0.8) while
destroying confidence diversity (std less than 0.05), symmetric losses fail to
escape binary signal averaging, and post-hoc methods achieve calibration (ECE
less than 0.02) only by compressing the confidence distribution. We formalize
this as an underspecified mapping problem where binary signals cannot
distinguish between different confidence levels for correct predictions: a 60
percent confident correct answer receives identical supervision to a 90 percent
confident one. Crucially, our real-world validation shows 100 percent failure
rate for all training methods across MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10, while
post-hoc calibration's 33 percent success rate paradoxically confirms our
theorem by achieving calibration through transformation rather than learning.
This impossibility directly explains neural network hallucinations and
establishes why post-hoc calibration is mathematically necessary, not merely
convenient. We propose novel supervision paradigms using ensemble disagreement
and adaptive multi-agent learning that could overcome these fundamental
limitations without requiring human confidence annotations.

Motivation: 扩展LLM上下文窗口对长序列任务很重要，但RoPE位置插值与后训练量化结合会导致精度下降，需要解决这一耦合效应问题。

Method: 提出Q-ROAR方法：将RoPE维度分组到频带，对W_Q和W_K进行每频带尺度搜索的权重稳定化，使用插值压力和尾部膨胀比作为诊断指标。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了位置插值与量化结合的精度下降问题，提供了一种无需架构更改的实用解决方案。

Abstract: Extending LLM context windows is crucial for long range tasks. RoPE-based
position interpolation (PI) methods like linear and frequency-aware scaling
extend input lengths without retraining, while post-training quantization (PTQ)
enables practical deployment. We show that combining PI with PTQ degrades
accuracy due to coupled effects long context aliasing, dynamic range dilation,
axis grid anisotropy, and outlier shifting that induce position-dependent logit
noise. We provide the first systematic analysis of PI plus PTQ and introduce
two diagnostics: Interpolation Pressure (per-band phase scaling sensitivity)
and Tail Inflation Ratios (outlier shift from short to long contexts). To
address this, we propose Q-ROAR, a RoPE-aware, weight-only stabilization that
groups RoPE dimensions into a few frequency bands and performs a small search
over per-band scales for W_Q,W_K, with an optional symmetric variant to
preserve logit scale. The diagnostics guided search uses a tiny long-context
dev set and requires no fine-tuning, kernel, or architecture changes.
Empirically, Q-ROAR recovers up to 0.7% accuracy on standard tasks and reduces
GovReport perplexity by more than 10%, while preserving short-context
performance and compatibility with existing inference stacks.

Abstract: Information retrieval with compact binary embeddings, also referred to as

hashing methods require expensive, scenario-specific training. In this work, we
introduce Hashing-Baseline, a strong training-free hashing method leveraging
powerful pretrained encoders that produce rich pretrained embeddings. We
revisit classical, training-free hashing techniques: principal component
analysis, random orthogonal projection, and threshold binarization, to produce
a strong baseline for hashing. Our approach combines these techniques with
frozen embeddings from state-of-the-art vision and audio encoders to yield
competitive retrieval performance without any additional learning or
fine-tuning. To demonstrate the generality and effectiveness of this approach,
we evaluate it on standard image retrieval benchmarks as well as a newly
introduced benchmark for audio hashing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习中可用用户分布(q)与优化目标分布(p)通常不一致，导致FedAvg产生有偏和不稳定的更新

Method: 将聚合问题建模为掩码最优传输问题，使用Sinkhorn缩放计算基于传输的聚合权重

Result: 在非光滑凸FL设置下达到标准O(1/√T)收敛率，实验显示在异构性、公平性和低参与度场景下性能大幅提升

Conclusion: FedAVOT有效解决了联邦学习中的分布不匹配问题，即使每轮只有两个客户端参与也能显著改善性能

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) allows distributed model training without sharing raw
data, but suffers when client participation is partial. In practice, the
distribution of available users (\emph{availability distribution} $q$) rarely
aligns with the distribution defining the optimization objective
(\emph{importance distribution} $p$), leading to biased and unstable updates
under classical FedAvg. We propose \textbf{Fereated AVerage with Optimal
Transport (\textbf{FedAVOT})}, which formulates aggregation as a masked optimal
transport problem aligning $q$ and $p$. Using Sinkhorn scaling,
\textbf{FedAVOT} computes transport-based aggregation weights with provable
convergence guarantees. \textbf{FedAVOT} achieves a standard
$\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{T})$ rate under a nonsmooth convex FL setting, independent
of the number of participating users per round. Our experiments confirm
drastically improved performance compared to FedAvg across heterogeneous,
fairness-sensitive, and low-availability regimes, even when only two clients
participate per round.

the quality of data fed into machine learning (ML) models is critical. The
H$\alpha$ observations from the GONG network represent one such data stream,
producing several observations per minute, 24/7, since 2010. In this study, we
introduce a lightweight (non-ML) anomaly-detection algorithm, called H-Alpha
Anomalyzer, designed to identify anomalous observations based on user-defined
criteria. Unlike many black-box algorithms, our approach highlights exactly
which regions triggered the anomaly flag and quantifies the corresponding
anomaly likelihood. For our comparative analysis, we also created and released
a dataset of 2,000 observations, equally divided between anomalous and
non-anomalous cases. Our results demonstrate that the proposed model not only
outperforms existing methods but also provides explainability, enabling
qualitative evaluation by domain experts.

*Ying Lin,Yao Kuang,Ahmet Alacaoglu,Michael P. Friedlander*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出随机局部协调方法，通过让每个节点独立采样一个正则项并仅与共享该正则项的节点协调，将每次迭代的通信量从O(m)降低到2条消息，同时保持收敛性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分布式优化中完全同步的通信开销随节点数量增加而急剧增长，特别是当存在大量成对正则项时，标准方法需要O(m)次通信。需要一种能减少通信开销同时保持收敛性的方法。

Method: 随机局部协调：每个节点独立均匀采样一个正则项，仅与共享该正则项的节点进行协调。用单个随机选择的正则项G_j的近端映射代替总和∑G_j的近端映射，避免全局协调。

Result: 对于图引导的正则项(|S_j|=2)，期望通信量降至每次迭代2条消息。凸目标达到Õ(ε⁻²)迭代次数，强凸情况下达到ε-解需要O(ε⁻¹)迭代，达到邻域需要O(log(1/ε))迭代。

Conclusion: 该方法成功利用部分可分离性，在保持收敛性的同时显著减少通信开销，实验验证了在合成和真实数据集上的收敛速率和通信效率。

Abstract: Distributed optimization requires nodes to coordinate, yet full
synchronization scales poorly. When $n$ nodes collaborate through $m$ pairwise
regularizers, standard methods demand $\mathcal{O}(m)$ communications per
iteration. This paper proposes randomized local coordination: each node
independently samples one regularizer uniformly and coordinates only with nodes
sharing that term. This exploits partial separability, where each regularizer
$G_j$ depends on a subset $S_j \subseteq \{1,\ldots,n\}$ of nodes. For
graph-guided regularizers where $|S_j|=2$, expected communication drops to
exactly 2 messages per iteration. This method achieves
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\varepsilon^{-2})$ iterations for convex objectives and
under strong convexity, $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-1})$ to an
$\varepsilon$-solution and $\mathcal{O}(\log(1/\varepsilon))$ to a
neighborhood. Replacing the proximal map of the sum $\sum_j G_j$ with the
proximal map of a single randomly selected regularizer $G_j$ preserves
convergence while eliminating global coordination. Experiments validate both
convergence rates and communication efficiency across synthetic and real-world
datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统静态分析难以应对现代恶意软件的代码混淆和多态技术，需要更有效的运行时行为检测方法。

Method: 利用大型语言模型从原始沙箱行为报告生成密集上下文嵌入，然后使用一维卷积神经网络进行多分类恶意软件检测。

Result: 在Avast-CTU Public CAPE数据集上评估，框架 consistently outperforms existing methods。

Conclusion: 基于LLM的行为嵌入和BEACON框架设计在恶意软件分类中表现出色，为行为恶意软件检测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Malware is becoming increasingly complex and widespread, making it essential
to develop more effective and timely detection methods. Traditional static
analysis often fails to defend against modern threats that employ code
obfuscation, polymorphism, and other evasion techniques. In contrast,
behavioral malware detection, which monitors runtime activities, provides a
more reliable and context-aware solution. In this work, we propose BEACON, a
novel deep learning framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to
generate dense, contextual embeddings from raw sandbox-generated behavior
reports. These embeddings capture semantic and structural patterns of each
sample and are processed by a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D
CNN) for multi-class malware classification. Evaluated on the Avast-CTU Public
CAPE Dataset, our framework consistently outperforms existing methods,
highlighting the effectiveness of LLM-based behavioral embeddings and the
overall design of BEACON for robust malware classification.

Motivation: 现有案例后缀预测方法只生成带单一时间戳的活动序列，无法满足资源容量规划需求，因为需要了解资源在不同时间段的工作负荷情况。

Method: 采用扫描线方法，同步预测所有进行中案例的后缀，预测每个活动的等待时间和处理时间，使用多模型方法进行案例后缀预测。

Conclusion: 提出的技术能够有效预测带时间戳的活动序列，为资源容量规划提供更全面的支持，多模型方法在案例后缀预测中表现出优越性。

Abstract: Predictive process monitoring techniques support the operational decision
making by predicting future states of ongoing cases of a business process. A
subset of these techniques predict the remaining sequence of activities of an
ongoing case (case suffix prediction). Existing approaches for case suffix
prediction generate sequences of activities with a single timestamp (e.g. the
end timestamp). This output is insufficient for resource capacity planning,
where we need to reason about the periods of time when resources will be busy
performing work. This paper introduces a technique for predicting case suffixes
consisting of activities with start and end timestamps. In other words, the
proposed technique predicts both the waiting time and the processing time of
each activity. Since the waiting time of an activity in a case depends on how
busy resources are in other cases, the technique adopts a sweep-line approach,
wherein the suffixes of all ongoing cases in the process are predicted in
lockstep, rather than predictions being made for each case in isolation. An
evaluation on real-life and synthetic datasets compares the accuracy of
different instantiations of this approach, demonstrating the advantages of a
multi-model approach to case suffix prediction.

Motivation: 现有Muon优化器及其变体在大模型训练中存在高样本复杂度或高内存消耗的问题，需要更高效的优化器

Method: 基于动量方差缩减技术和随机奇异值分解(SVD)，构建LiMuon优化器

Result: LiMuon比现有Muon变体内存更低，在平滑条件下样本复杂度为O(ε⁻³)，在广义平滑条件下也达到相同复杂度

Conclusion: LiMuon优化器在大模型训练中表现出高效性，在DistilGPT2和ViT模型上的实验验证了其有效性

Abstract: Large models recently are widely applied in artificial intelligence, so
efficient training of large models has received widespread attention. More
recently, a useful Muon optimizer is specifically designed for
matrix-structured parameters of large models. Although some works have begun to
studying Muon optimizer, the existing Muon and its variants still suffer from
high sample complexity or high memory for large models. To fill this gap, we
propose a light and fast Muon (LiMuon) optimizer for training large models,
which builds on the momentum-based variance reduced technique and randomized
Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). Our LiMuon optimizer has a lower memory
than the current Muon and its variants. Moreover, we prove that our LiMuon has
a lower sample complexity of $O(\epsilon^{-3})$ for finding an
$\epsilon$-stationary solution of non-convex stochastic optimization under the
smooth condition. Recently, the existing convergence analysis of Muon optimizer
mainly relies on the strict Lipschitz smooth assumption, while some artificial
intelligence tasks such as training large language models (LLMs) do not satisfy
this condition. We also proved that our LiMuon optimizer has a sample
complexity of $O(\epsilon^{-3})$ under the generalized smooth condition.
Numerical experimental results on training DistilGPT2 and ViT models verify
efficiency of our LiMuon optimizer.

Conclusion: A²SL框架虽然专注于淡水生态系统，但为各科学领域提供了广泛适用的解决方案

Abstract: The discovery of environmental knowledge depends on labeled task-specific
data, but is often constrained by the high cost of data collection. Existing
machine learning approaches usually struggle to generalize in data-sparse or
atypical conditions. To this end, we propose an Augmentation-Adaptive
Self-Supervised Learning (A$^2$SL) framework, which retrieves relevant
observational samples to enhance modeling of the target ecosystem.
Specifically, we introduce a multi-level pairwise learning loss to train a
scenario encoder that captures varying degrees of similarity among scenarios.
These learned similarities drive a retrieval mechanism that supplements a
target scenario with relevant data from different locations or time periods.
Furthermore, to better handle variable scenarios, particularly under atypical
or extreme conditions where traditional models struggle, we design an
augmentation-adaptive mechanism that selectively enhances these scenarios
through targeted data augmentation. Using freshwater ecosystems as a case
study, we evaluate A$^2$SL in modeling water temperature and dissolved oxygen
dynamics in real-world lakes. Experimental results show that A$^2$SL
significantly improves predictive accuracy and enhances robustness in
data-scarce and atypical scenarios. Although this study focuses on freshwater
ecosystems, the A$^2$SL framework offers a broadly applicable solution in
various scientific domains.

TL;DR: 提出了SPMD-LRT方法，直接在张量表示上操作，通过低秩分解保持高维张量数据的结构信息，优化边际分布以提高分类性能


<details>

Motivation: 现有的LMDM方法仅限于向量化输入，处理高维张量数据时需要展平操作，这会破坏数据的多模态结构并增加计算负担

Method: 结合一阶和二阶张量统计量（边际均值和方差）到目标函数中，利用低秩张量分解技术（包括rank-1 CP、高阶CP和Tucker分解）参数化权重张量，开发交替优化算法

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，SPMD-LRT相比传统SVM、基于向量的LMDM以及先前的张量SVM扩展方法获得了更优的分类准确率，特别是Tucker分解版本的SPMD-LRT表现最佳

Conclusion: SPMD-LRT在处理高维张量数据分类方面具有有效性和鲁棒性，结构保持方法显著提升了分类性能

Abstract: The Large Margin Distribution Machine (LMDM) is a recent advancement in
classifier design that optimizes not just the minimum margin (as in SVM) but
the entire margin distribution, thereby improving generalization. However,
existing LMDM formulations are limited to vectorized inputs and struggle with
high-dimensional tensor data due to the need for flattening, which destroys the
data's inherent multi-mode structure and increases computational burden. In
this paper, we propose a Structure-Preserving Margin Distribution Learning for
High-Order Tensor Data with Low-Rank Decomposition (SPMD-LRT) that operates
directly on tensor representations without vectorization. The SPMD-LRT
preserves multi-dimensional spatial structure by incorporating first-order and
second-order tensor statistics (margin mean and variance) into the objective,
and it leverages low-rank tensor decomposition techniques including rank-1(CP),
higher-rank CP, and Tucker decomposition to parameterize the weight tensor. An
alternating optimization (double-gradient descent) algorithm is developed to
efficiently solve the SPMD-LRT, iteratively updating factor matrices and core
tensor. This approach enables SPMD-LRT to maintain the structural information
of high-order data while optimizing margin distribution for improved
classification. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets (including MNIST,
images and fMRI neuroimaging) demonstrate that SPMD-LRT achieves superior
classification accuracy compared to conventional SVM, vector-based LMDM, and
prior tensor-based SVM extensions (Support Tensor Machines and Support Tucker
Machines). Notably, SPMD-LRT with Tucker decomposition attains the highest
accuracy, highlighting the benefit of structure preservation. These results
confirm the effectiveness and robustness of SPMD-LRT in handling
high-dimensional tensor data for classification.

Motivation: 扩展离线高斯混合模型Q函数到在线学习，利用流数据促进探索，通过稀疏化控制模型复杂度，解决深度强化学习方法参数过多和低参数情况下泛化能力差的问题。

Method: 构建稀疏高斯混合模型Q函数(S-GMM-QFs)，采用Hadamard过参数化实现稀疏化，在黎曼流形结构上进行在线梯度下降优化，开发在线策略迭代框架。

Result: 在标准基准测试中性能与密集深度强化学习方法相当，但使用参数显著减少，在低参数情况下仍保持强性能，而稀疏化深度强化学习方法无法泛化。

Conclusion: 稀疏高斯混合模型Q函数提供了一种结构化、可解释的在线强化学习框架，在保持高性能的同时实现了参数效率，特别适合资源受限的应用场景。

Abstract: This paper introduces a structured and interpretable online policy-iteration
framework for reinforcement learning (RL), built around the novel class of
sparse Gaussian mixture model Q-functions (S-GMM-QFs). Extending earlier work
that trained GMM-QFs offline, the proposed framework develops an online scheme
that leverages streaming data to encourage exploration. Model complexity is
regulated through sparsification by Hadamard overparametrization, which
mitigates overfitting while preserving expressiveness. The parameter space of
S-GMM-QFs is naturally endowed with a Riemannian manifold structure, allowing
for principled parameter updates via online gradient descent on a smooth
objective. Numerical tests show that S-GMM-QFs match the performance of dense
deep RL (DeepRL) methods on standard benchmarks while using significantly fewer
parameters, and maintain strong performance even in low-parameter-count regimes
where sparsified DeepRL methods fail to generalize.

Result: 能量匹配未产生统计显著的精度改进，但揭示了模型在泛化自由能表面时的不同倾向性

Conclusion: 研究结果为通过改进能量估计技术和多模态损失公式来增强粗粒度建模提供了未来机遇

Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations provide atomistic insight into
biomolecular systems but are often limited by high computational costs required
to access long timescales. Coarse-grained machine learning models offer a
promising avenue for accelerating sampling, yet conventional force matching
approaches often fail to capture the full thermodynamic landscape as fitting a
model on the gradient may not fit the absolute differences between low-energy
conformational states. In this work, we incorporate a complementary energy
matching term into the loss function. We evaluate our framework on the
Chignolin protein using the CGSchNet model, systematically varying the weight
of the energy loss term. While energy matching did not yield statistically
significant improvements in accuracy, it revealed distinct tendencies in how
models generalize the free energy surface. Our results suggest future
opportunities to enhance coarse-grained modeling through improved energy
estimation techniques and multi-modal loss formulations.

Motivation: 传统分割联邦学习在交换中间激活和模型更新时存在严重的隐私风险，特别是数据重建攻击可以从中间表示恢复原始输入。现有的噪声注入防御方法往往会降低模型性能。

Method: 提出PM-SFL框架，采用概率掩码训练添加结构化随机性而不依赖显式噪声；使用个性化掩码学习适应数据异构性；引入分层知识补偿机制处理系统异构性。

Result: 理论分析证实了隐私保护能力，在图像和无线感知任务上的实验表明PM-SFL持续提高了准确性、通信效率和对隐私攻击的鲁棒性，在数据和系统异构性下表现尤为突出。

Conclusion: PM-SFL提供了一个可扩展且保护隐私的分割联邦学习解决方案，有效解决了隐私风险和异构性挑战，同时保持了模型效用。

Abstract: Split Federated Learning (SFL) has emerged as an efficient alternative to
traditional Federated Learning (FL) by reducing client-side computation through
model partitioning. However, exchanging of intermediate activations and model
updates introduces significant privacy risks, especially from data
reconstruction attacks that recover original inputs from intermediate
representations. Existing defenses using noise injection often degrade model
performance. To overcome these challenges, we present PM-SFL, a scalable and
privacy-preserving SFL framework that incorporates Probabilistic Mask training
to add structured randomness without relying on explicit noise. This mitigates
data reconstruction risks while maintaining model utility. To address data
heterogeneity, PM-SFL employs personalized mask learning that tailors submodel
structures to each client's local data. For system heterogeneity, we introduce
a layer-wise knowledge compensation mechanism, enabling clients with varying
resources to participate effectively under adaptive model splitting.
Theoretical analysis confirms its privacy protection, and experiments on image
and wireless sensing tasks demonstrate that PM-SFL consistently improves
accuracy, communication efficiency, and robustness to privacy attacks, with
particularly strong performance under data and system heterogeneity.

Abstract: Energy-efficient medical data classification is essential for modern disease
screening, particularly in home and field healthcare where embedded devices are
prevalent. While deep learning models achieve state-of-the-art accuracy, their
substantial energy consumption and reliance on GPUs limit deployment on such
platforms. We present Hyperdimensional Computing with Class-Wise Clustering

them into multiple cluster-specific prototypes, and performs classification
through similarity search in hyperspace. We evaluate HD3C across three medical
classification tasks; on heart sound classification, HD3C is $350\times$ more
energy-efficient than Bayesian ResNet with less than 1% accuracy difference.
Moreover, HD3C demonstrates exceptional robustness to noise, limited training

Result: 实验验证了方法的合理性和有效性，显著缩小了与黄金标准重训练方法的差距

Conclusion: 课程遗忘概念具有重要研究潜力，为机器遗忘领域的发展提供了前瞻性见解

Abstract: As privacy and security take center stage in AI, machine unlearning, the
ability to erase specific knowledge from models, has garnered increasing
attention. However, existing methods overly prioritize efficiency and
aggressive forgetting, which introduces notable limitations. In particular,
radical interventions like gradient ascent, influence functions, and random
label noise can destabilize model weights, leading to collapse and reduced
reliability. To address this, we propose CUFG (Curriculum Unlearning via
Forgetting Gradients), a novel framework that enhances the stability of
approximate unlearning through innovations in both forgetting mechanisms and
data scheduling strategies. Specifically, CUFG integrates a new gradient
corrector guided by forgetting gradients for fine-tuning-based unlearning and a
curriculum unlearning paradigm that progressively forgets from easy to hard.
These innovations narrow the gap with the gold-standard Retrain method by
enabling more stable and progressive unlearning, thereby improving both
effectiveness and reliability. Furthermore, we believe that the concept of
curriculum unlearning has substantial research potential and offers
forward-looking insights for the development of the MU field. Extensive
experiments across various forgetting scenarios validate the rationale and
effectiveness of our approach and CUFG. Codes are available at

Abstract: Existing positional encoding methods in transformers are fundamentally
signal-agnostic, deriving positional information solely from sequence indices
while ignoring the underlying signal characteristics. This limitation is
particularly problematic for time series analysis, where signals exhibit

improvements of 9.1\% compared to baseline sinusoidal absolute position
encoding in biomedical signals, while maintaining competitive computational
efficiency.

Result: 在10个数据集上取得state-of-the-art结果，ETTh1数据集上MSE提升3%，仅使用PatchTST 37%的计算资源(FLOPs)

Conclusion: DeCoP框架通过显式建模动态多尺度依赖关系，有效提升了时间序列预训练模型的泛化能力和计算效率

Abstract: Modeling dynamic temporal dependencies is a critical challenge in time series
pre-training, which evolve due to distribution shifts and multi-scale patterns.
This temporal variability severely impairs the generalization of pre-trained
models to downstream tasks. Existing frameworks fail to capture the complex
interactions of short- and long-term dependencies, making them susceptible to
spurious correlations that degrade generalization. To address these
limitations, we propose DeCoP, a Dependency Controlled Pre-training framework
that explicitly models dynamic, multi-scale dependencies by simulating evolving
inter-patch dependencies. At the input level, DeCoP introduces Instance-wise
Patch Normalization (IPN) to mitigate distributional shifts while preserving
the unique characteristics of each patch, creating a robust foundation for
representation learning. At the latent level, a hierarchical Dependency
Controlled Learning (DCL) strategy explicitly models inter-patch dependencies
across multiple temporal scales, with an Instance-level Contrastive Module
(ICM) enhances global generalization by learning instance-discriminative
representations from time-invariant positive pairs. DeCoP achieves
state-of-the-art results on ten datasets with lower computing resources,
improving MSE by 3% on ETTh1 over PatchTST using only 37% of the FLOPs.

*Hyungjoon Soh,Junghyo Jo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于时钟机制的连续序列注意力模型，通过概率建模实现因果、平滑、近对角对齐，无需外部位置正则化，在文本转语音任务中表现优异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准点积注意力缺乏连续性和单调性约束，而这对帧同步任务至关重要。需要一种能够显式建模对齐的注意力机制

Method: 通过学习源序列和目标序列的非负时钟，将注意力建模为时钟相遇概率，通过路径积分推导得到高斯式评分规则，支持并行和自回归两种解码模式

Result: 在Transformer文本转语音测试中，该模型产生更稳定的对齐，对全局时间缩放具有更好的鲁棒性，同时保持或提高了准确率

Conclusion: 该时钟注意力框架为连续目标序列建模提供了有效解决方案，有望应用于视频和时序信号建模等其他领域

Abstract: We formulate an attention mechanism for continuous and ordered sequences that
explicitly functions as an alignment model, which serves as the core of many
sequence-to-sequence tasks. Standard scaled dot-product attention relies on
positional encodings and masks but does not enforce continuity or monotonicity,
which are crucial for frame-synchronous targets. We propose learned nonnegative
\emph{clocks} to source and target and model attention as the meeting
probability of these clocks; a path-integral derivation yields a closed-form,
Gaussian-like scoring rule with an intrinsic bias toward causal, smooth,
near-diagonal alignments, without external positional regularizers. The
framework supports two complementary regimes: normalized clocks for parallel
decoding when a global length is available, and unnormalized clocks for
autoregressive decoding -- both nearly-parameter-free, drop-in replacements. In
a Transformer text-to-speech testbed, this construction produces more stable
alignments and improved robustness to global time-scaling while matching or
improving accuracy over scaled dot-product baselines. We hypothesize
applicability to other continuous targets, including video and temporal signal
modeling.

*Zihao Feng,Xiaoxue Wang,Bowen Wu,Hailong Cao,Tiejun Zhao,Qun Yu,Baoxun Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DSCL框架通过基于奖励的动态采样和基于任务的动态课程学习，解决RL在工具学习中样本效率低下的问题，显著提升训练效率和模型性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有动态采样技术不适用于工具学习的多任务结构和细粒度奖励机制，简单样本过多导致学习效率低下

Method: DSCL包含两个核心组件：基于奖励的动态采样（使用多维奖励统计信息优先处理有价值数据）和基于任务的动态课程学习（自适应关注未掌握的子任务）

Result: 在BFCLv3基准测试上实现了3.29%的性能提升，显著改善了训练效率和模型性能

Conclusion: DSCL为工具学习提供了量身定制的解决方案，有效利用复杂奖励信号和子任务动态实现优异结果

Abstract: While reinforcement learning (RL) is increasingly used for LLM-based tool
learning, its efficiency is often hampered by an overabundance of simple
samples that provide diminishing learning value as training progresses.
Existing dynamic sampling techniques are ill-suited for the multi-task
structure and fine-grained reward mechanisms inherent to tool learning. This
paper introduces Dynamic Sampling with Curriculum Learning (DSCL), a framework
specifically designed to address this challenge by targeting the unique
characteristics of tool learning: its multiple interdependent sub-tasks and
multi-valued reward functions. DSCL features two core components: Reward-Based
Dynamic Sampling, which uses multi-dimensional reward statistics (mean and
variance) to prioritize valuable data, and Task-Based Dynamic Curriculum
Learning, which adaptively focuses training on less-mastered sub-tasks. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that DSCL significantly improves training
efficiency and model performance over strong baselines, achieving a 3.29\%
improvement on the BFCLv3 benchmark. Our method provides a tailored solution
that effectively leverages the complex reward signals and sub-task dynamics
within tool learning to achieve superior results.

TL;DR: 本文提出了PreGC方法，通过最优传输实现预训练图压缩，突破传统方法对特定任务和架构的依赖，实现通用图表示学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图压缩方法严重依赖特定GNN架构和任务监督，限制了其复用性和跨任务泛化能力。

Method: 提出基于最优传输的预训练图压缩框架，包括混合间隔图扩散增强、表示传输计划匹配和可追溯语义协调器。

Result: 大量实验验证了PreGC的优越性和通用性，展示了其任务无关特性和与任意GNN的无缝兼容性。

Conclusion: PreGC通过优化一致性框架和最优传输技术，成功实现了任务和架构无关的通用图压缩方法。

Abstract: Graph condensation (GC) aims to distill the original graph into a small-scale
graph, mitigating redundancy and accelerating GNN training. However,
conventional GC approaches heavily rely on rigid GNNs and task-specific
supervision. Such a dependency severely restricts their reusability and
generalization across various tasks and architectures. In this work, we revisit
the goal of ideal GC from the perspective of GNN optimization consistency, and
then a generalized GC optimization objective is derived, by which those
traditional GC methods can be viewed nicely as special cases of this
optimization paradigm. Based on this, Pre-trained Graph Condensation (PreGC)
via optimal transport is proposed to transcend the limitations of task- and
architecture-dependent GC methods. Specifically, a hybrid-interval graph
diffusion augmentation is presented to suppress the weak generalization ability
of the condensed graph on particular architectures by enhancing the uncertainty
of node states. Meanwhile, the matching between optimal graph transport plan
and representation transport plan is tactfully established to maintain semantic
consistencies across source graph and condensed graph spaces, thereby freeing
graph condensation from task dependencies. To further facilitate the adaptation
of condensed graphs to various downstream tasks, a traceable semantic
harmonizer from source nodes to condensed nodes is proposed to bridge semantic
associations through the optimized representation transport plan in
pre-training. Extensive experiments verify the superiority and versatility of
PreGC, demonstrating its task-independent nature and seamless compatibility
with arbitrary GNNs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单细胞基础模型虽然性能优异，但决策过程缺乏可解释性，传统方法如差异基因表达分析更易理解，需要开发新方法来提升模型透明度

Method: 在先进的单细胞基础模型cell2sentence上训练transcoder，利用该工具提取模型内部的决策电路

Result: 提取的决策电路能够对应到真实的生物学机制，验证了transcoder在揭示复杂单细胞模型中生物学通路的能力

Conclusion: transcoder技术具有从复杂单细胞模型中提取生物学可信通路的潜力，为提升单细胞基础模型的可解释性提供了有效途径

Abstract: Single-cell foundation models (scFMs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art
performance on various tasks, such as cell-type annotation and perturbation
response prediction, by learning gene regulatory networks from large-scale
transcriptome data. However, a significant challenge remains: the
decision-making processes of these models are less interpretable compared to
traditional methods like differential gene expression analysis. Recently,
transcoders have emerged as a promising approach for extracting interpretable
decision circuits from large language models (LLMs). In this work, we train a
transcoder on the cell2sentence (C2S) model, a state-of-the-art scFM. By
leveraging the trained transcoder, we extract internal decision-making circuits
from the C2S model. We demonstrate that the discovered circuits correspond to
real-world biological mechanisms, confirming the potential of transcoders to
uncover biologically plausible pathways within complex single-cell models.

*Zhiyuan Xue,Ben Yang,Xuetao Zhang,Fei Wang,Zhiping Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的一步多视图聚类方法OMCAL，通过自适应低秩锚图学习解决现有方法的信息冗余和噪声干扰问题，同时将类别指示器获取与锚图学习统一到一个框架中，显著提升了聚类效果和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于锚图的多视图聚类方法存在两个主要问题：1）直接将多样锚图嵌入到共识锚图中，忽略了冗余信息和噪声，导致聚类效果下降；2）需要独立的后续处理来获取聚类指示器，降低了效率和效果。

Method: 提出了OMCAL方法，使用基于核范数的自适应共识锚图学习模型来对抗信息冗余和噪声干扰，并将类别指示器获取与共识锚图学习整合到统一框架中，实现一步式聚类。

Result: 在普通和大规模数据集上的大量实验表明，OMCAL在聚类效果和效率方面都优于现有的最先进方法。

Conclusion: OMCAL方法通过自适应低秩锚图学习和统一框架设计，有效解决了多视图聚类中的信息冗余和效率问题，为大规模聚类问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: In light of their capability to capture structural information while reducing
computing complexity, anchor graph-based multi-view clustering (AGMC) methods
have attracted considerable attention in large-scale clustering problems.
Nevertheless, existing AGMC methods still face the following two issues: 1)
They directly embedded diverse anchor graphs into a consensus anchor graph
(CAG), and hence ignore redundant information and numerous noises contained in
these anchor graphs, leading to a decrease in clustering effectiveness; 2) They
drop effectiveness and efficiency due to independent post-processing to acquire
clustering indicators. To overcome the aforementioned issues, we deliver a
novel one-step multi-view clustering method with adaptive low-rank anchor-graph
learning (OMCAL). To construct a high-quality CAG, OMCAL provides a nuclear
norm-based adaptive CAG learning model against information redundancy and noise
interference. Then, to boost clustering effectiveness and efficiency
substantially, we incorporate category indicator acquisition and CAG learning
into a unified framework. Numerous studies conducted on ordinary and
large-scale datasets indicate that OMCAL outperforms existing state-of-the-art
methods in terms of clustering effectiveness and efficiency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FlowCast-ODE是一个基于连续流建模的小时级天气预报框架，通过ODE求解器和粗到细策略解决自回归误差累积和数据同化周期不连续性问题，在保持精度的同时减小模型规模15%。


<details>

Conclusion: FlowCast-ODE通过连续流建模和ODE求解器成功解决了小时级天气预报的关键挑战，在精度、效率和极端事件预测方面都表现出色，为高时间分辨率天气预报提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate hourly weather forecasting is critical for numerous applications.
Recent deep learning models have demonstrated strong capability on 6-hour
intervals, yet achieving accurate and stable hourly predictions remains a
critical challenge. This is primarily due to the rapid accumulation of errors
in autoregressive rollouts and temporal discontinuities within the ERA5 data's
12-hour assimilation cycle. To address these issues, we propose FlowCast-ODE, a
framework that models atmospheric state evolution as a continuous flow.
FlowCast-ODE learns the conditional flow path directly from the previous state,
an approach that aligns more naturally with physical dynamic systems and
enables efficient computation. A coarse-to-fine strategy is introduced to train
the model on 6-hour data using dynamic flow matching and then refined on hourly
data that incorporates an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) solver to
achieve temporally coherent forecasts. In addition, a lightweight low-rank
AdaLN-Zero modulation mechanism is proposed and reduces model size by 15%
without compromising accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that FlowCast-ODE
outperforms strong baselines, yielding lower root mean square error (RMSE) and
better energy conservation, which reduces blurring and preserves more
fine-scale spatial details. It also shows comparable performance to the
state-of-the-art model in forecasting extreme events like typhoons.
Furthermore, the model alleviates temporal discontinuities associated with
assimilation cycle transitions.

Motivation: 计算资源增长速度远超语言模型预训练所需的网络文本数据增长速度，需要研究在固定数据量下如何最大化预训练性能。

Method: 1. 识别现有数据约束方法（增加迭代次数和参数数量）的过拟合问题 2. 通过优化正则化参数（权重衰减强度30倍）提升性能 3. 采用集成学习技术获得更低的损失趋势 4. 结合迭代、正则化、参数扩大和集成扩缩等多种技术 5. 使用矩阵缩减技术将集成模型短粒度到小规模模型

Conclusion: 简单的算法改进可以在计算资源丰富的未来实现显著的数据效率提升，为语言模型预训练提供了更有效的路径。

Abstract: Since compute grows much faster than web text available for language model
pre-training, we ask how one should approach pre-training under fixed data and
no compute constraints. We first show that existing data-constrained approaches
of increasing epoch count and parameter count eventually overfit, and we
significantly improve upon such recipes by properly tuning regularization,
finding that the optimal weight decay is $30\times$ larger than standard
practice. Since our regularized recipe monotonically decreases loss following a
simple power law in parameter count, we estimate its best possible performance
via the asymptote of its scaling law rather than the performance at a fixed
compute budget. We then identify that ensembling independently trained models
achieves a significantly lower loss asymptote than the regularized recipe. Our
best intervention combining epoching, regularization, parameter scaling, and
ensemble scaling achieves an asymptote at 200M tokens using $5.17\times$ less
data than our baseline, and our data scaling laws predict that this improvement
persists at higher token budgets. We find that our data efficiency gains can be
realized at much smaller parameter counts as we can distill an ensemble into a
student model that is 8$\times$ smaller and retains $83\%$ of the ensembling
benefit. Finally, our interventions designed for validation loss generalize to
downstream benchmarks, achieving a $9\%$ improvement for pre-training evals and
a $17.5\times$ data efficiency improvement over continued pre-training on math
mid-training data. Our results show that simple algorithmic improvements can
enable significantly more data-efficient pre-training in a compute-rich future.

Abstract: Accurate identification of drug-target interactions (DTI) remains a central
challenge in computational pharmacology, where sequence-based methods offer
scalability. This work introduces a sequence-based drug-target interaction
framework that integrates structural priors into protein representations while
maintaining high-throughput screening capability. Evaluated across multiple
benchmarks, the model achieves state-of-the-art performance on Human and
BioSNAP datasets and remains competitive on BindingDB. In virtual screening
tasks, it surpasses prior methods on LIT-PCBA, yielding substantial gains in
AUROC and BEDROC. Ablation studies confirm the critical role of learned
aggregation, bilinear attention, and contrastive alignment in enhancing
predictive robustness. Embedding visualizations reveal improved spatial
correspondence with known binding pockets and highlight interpretable attention
patterns over ligand-residue contacts. These results validate the framework's
utility for scalable and structure-aware DTI prediction.

Motivation: 现有轨迹预测模型的评估标准不统一，缺乏对异构交通场景、联合预测模型的支持，需要一个新的基准框架来促进模型比较和深入分析。

Abstract: While trajectory prediction plays a critical role in enabling safe and
effective path-planning in automated vehicles, standardized practices for
evaluating such models remain underdeveloped. Recent efforts have aimed to
unify dataset formats and model interfaces for easier comparisons, yet existing
frameworks often fall short in supporting heterogeneous traffic scenarios,
joint prediction models, or user documentation. In this work, we introduce STEP
-- a new benchmarking framework that addresses these limitations by providing a
unified interface for multiple datasets, enforcing consistent training and
evaluation conditions, and supporting a wide range of prediction models. We
demonstrate the capabilities of STEP in a number of experiments which reveal 1)
the limitations of widely-used testing procedures, 2) the importance of joint
modeling of agents for better predictions of interactions, and 3) the
vulnerability of current state-of-the-art models against both distribution
shifts and targeted attacks by adversarial agents. With STEP, we aim to shift
the focus from the ``leaderboard'' approach to deeper insights about model
behavior and generalization in complex multi-agent settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了精度神经网络(PNNs)，通过在精度矩阵(逆协方差矩阵)上进行卷积来克服协方差神经网络(VNNs)的局限性，实现了任务感知的联合学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 协方差矩阵通常是密集的、无法编码条件独立性，并且通常以任务无关的方式预计算，这可能会影响性能。为了克服这些限制，研究精度矩阵上的神经网络。

Method: 提出精度神经网络(PNNs)，通过交替优化联合学习网络参数和精度矩阵，依次更新网络权重和精度估计。

Result: 理论上界定了估计精度矩阵与真实精度矩阵之间的距离，并在合成和真实数据上证明了联合估计相比两步方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 精度神经网络通过利用精度矩阵的稀疏性和条件独立性编码能力，提供了比协方差神经网络更优越的性能和理论保证。

Abstract: CoVariance Neural Networks (VNNs) perform convolutions on the graph
determined by the covariance matrix of the data, which enables expressive and
stable covariance-based learning. However, covariance matrices are typically
dense, fail to encode conditional independence, and are often precomputed in a
task-agnostic way, which may hinder performance. To overcome these limitations,
we study Precision Neural Networks (PNNs), i.e., VNNs on the precision matrix
-- the inverse covariance. The precision matrix naturally encodes statistical
independence, often exhibits sparsity, and preserves the covariance spectral
structure. To make precision estimation task-aware, we formulate an
optimization problem that jointly learns the network parameters and the
precision matrix, and solve it via alternating optimization, by sequentially
updating the network weights and the precision estimate. We theoretically bound
the distance between the estimated and true precision matrices at each
iteration, and demonstrate the effectiveness of joint estimation compared to
two-step approaches on synthetic and real-world data.

Motivation: 随机预测对于不确定系统（如能源市场和金融）的高效决策至关重要，需要估计未来情景的完整分布

Method: DST递归采样未来轨迹并通过聚类将其组织成树状结构，确保每个阶段的非预期性（决策仅依赖于观测历史）

Result: 在纽约州日前电力市场的能源套利优化任务中，DST方法持续优于使用传统模型场景树的优化算法和模型无关强化学习基线

Conclusion: 使用DST进行随机优化能产生更高效的决策策略，通过更好地处理不确定性，比使用相同扩散预测器的确定性和随机MPC变体获得更高性能

Abstract: Stochastic forecasting is critical for efficient decision-making in uncertain
systems, such as energy markets and finance, where estimating the full
distribution of future scenarios is essential. We propose Diffusion Scenario
Tree (DST), a general framework for constructing scenario trees for
multivariate prediction tasks using diffusion-based probabilistic forecasting
models. DST recursively samples future trajectories and organizes them into a
tree via clustering, ensuring non-anticipativity (decisions depending only on
observed history) at each stage. We evaluate the framework on the optimization
task of energy arbitrage in New York State's day-ahead electricity market.
Experimental results show that our approach consistently outperforms the same
optimization algorithms that use scenario trees from more conventional models
and Model-Free Reinforcement Learning baselines. Furthermore, using DST for
stochastic optimization yields more efficient decision policies, achieving
higher performance by better handling uncertainty than deterministic and
stochastic MPC variants using the same diffusion-based forecaster.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RL需要与高保真模拟器大量交互成本高，离线RL受限于数据集质量，现有混合方法只使用单一模拟器，而现实中存在多个不同保真度和成本的模拟器

Method: 基于信息增益最大化的多保真度混合RL算法(MF-HRL-IGM)，通过自举方法实现保真度选择，最大化信息增益

Result: 理论分析证明算法具有无遗憾特性，实证评估显示其性能优于现有基准方法

Conclusion: MF-HRL-IGM算法能够有效利用多保真度模拟器，在固定成本预算下实现更好的策略优化效果

Abstract: Optimizing a reinforcement learning (RL) policy typically requires extensive
interactions with a high-fidelity simulator of the environment, which are often
costly or impractical. Offline RL addresses this problem by allowing training
from pre-collected data, but its effectiveness is strongly constrained by the
size and quality of the dataset. Hybrid offline-online RL leverages both
offline data and interactions with a single simulator of the environment. In
many real-world scenarios, however, multiple simulators with varying levels of
fidelity and computational cost are available. In this work, we study
multi-fidelity hybrid RL for policy optimization under a fixed cost budget. We
introduce multi-fidelity hybrid RL via information gain maximization
(MF-HRL-IGM), a hybrid offline-online RL algorithm that implements fidelity
selection based on information gain maximization through a bootstrapping
approach. Theoretical analysis establishes the no-regret property of
MF-HRL-IGM, while empirical evaluations demonstrate its superior performance
compared to existing benchmarks.

Motivation: 传统图变换器将GNN与全局注意力并行或顺序集成，可能导致局部邻域信息在注意力机制中被稀释，造成信息损失。

Method: 提出全局到局部注意力方案：浅层使用注意力机制捕获全局信息，深层使用GNN模块学习局部结构信息，并引入跨层信息融合策略。

Result: 在节点级和图级任务上与最先进的线性图变换器和GNN相比，G2LFormer表现出优异性能。

Conclusion: 全局到局部注意力方案是可行的，G2LFormer在保持线性复杂度的同时实现了优秀的性能表现。

Abstract: Graph Transformers (GTs) show considerable potential in graph representation
learning. The architecture of GTs typically integrates Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs) with global attention mechanisms either in parallel or as a precursor to
attention mechanisms, yielding a local-and-global or local-to-global attention
scheme. However, as the global attention mechanism primarily captures
long-range dependencies between nodes, these integration schemes may suffer
from information loss, where the local neighborhood information learned by GNN
could be diluted by the attention mechanism. Therefore, we propose G2LFormer,
featuring a novel global-to-local attention scheme where the shallow network
layers use attention mechanisms to capture global information, while the deeper
layers employ GNN modules to learn local structural information, thereby
preventing nodes from ignoring their immediate neighbors. An effective
cross-layer information fusion strategy is introduced to allow local layers to
retain beneficial information from global layers and alleviate information
loss, with acceptable trade-offs in scalability. To validate the feasibility of
the global-to-local attention scheme, we compare G2LFormer with
state-of-the-art linear GTs and GNNs on node-level and graph-level tasks. The
results indicate that G2LFormer exhibits excellent performance while keeping
linear complexity.

Motivation: 验证DPANet架构中双域信息融合和交叉注意力机制的重要性

Method: 通过消融实验设计不同变体：仅时间域模型、仅频率域模型、无交叉融合机制模型，与完整模型进行对比

Result: 完整模型在所有变体中表现最佳；双域变体显著劣于完整模型；无交叉注意力机制的模型性能下降最严重

Conclusion: 时间域和频率域的异质信息融合至关重要，交叉注意力交互融合块是最关键的组件

Abstract: We conducted rigorous ablation studies to validate DPANet's key components
(Table \ref{tab:ablation-study}). The full model consistently outperforms all
variants. To test our dual-domain hypothesis, we designed two specialized
versions: a Temporal-Only model (fusing two identical temporal pyramids) and a
Frequency-Only model (fusing two spectral pyramids). Both variants
underperformed significantly, confirming that the fusion of heterogeneous
temporal and frequency information is critical. Furthermore, replacing the
cross-attention mechanism with a simpler method (w/o Cross-Fusion) caused the
most severe performance degradation. This result underscores that our
interactive fusion block is the most essential component.

Abstract: Learning the graph underlying a networked system from nodal signals is
crucial to downstream tasks in graph signal processing and machine learning.
The presence of hidden nodes whose signals are not observable might corrupt the
estimated graph. While existing works proposed various robustifications of
vanilla graph learning objectives by explicitly accounting for the presence of
these hidden nodes, a robustness analysis of "naive", hidden-node agnostic
approaches is still underexplored. This work demonstrates that vanilla graph
topology learning methods are implicitly robust to partial observations of
low-pass filtered graph signals. We achieve this theoretical result through
extending the restricted isometry property (RIP) to the Dirichlet energy
function used in graph learning objectives. We show that smoothness-based graph
learning formulation (e.g., the GL-SigRep method) on partial observations can
recover the ground truth graph topology corresponding to the observed nodes.
Synthetic and real data experiments corroborate our findings.

Abstract: Experimental studies of beauty hadron decays face significant challenges due
to a wide range of backgrounds arising from the numerous possible decay
channels with similar final states. For a particular signal decay, the process
for ascertaining the most relevant background processes necessitates a detailed
analysis of final state particles, potential misidentifications, and kinematic
overlaps, which, due to computational limitations, is restricted to the
simulation of only the most relevant backgrounds. Moreover, this process
typically relies on the physicist's intuition and expertise, as no systematic
method exists.
  This paper has two primary goals. First, from a particle physics perspective,
we present a novel approach that utilises Reinforcement Learning (RL) to
overcome the aforementioned challenges by systematically determining the
critical backgrounds affecting beauty hadron decay measurements. While beauty
hadron physics serves as the case study in this work, the proposed strategy is
broadly adaptable to other types of particle physics measurements. Second, from
a Machine Learning perspective, we introduce a novel algorithm which exploits
the synergy between RL and Genetic Algorithms (GAs) for environments with
highly sparse rewards and a large trajectory space. This strategy leverages GAs
to efficiently explore the trajectory space and identify successful
trajectories, which are used to guide the RL agent's training. Our method also
incorporates a transformer architecture for the RL agent to handle token
sequences representing decays.

Motivation: 经典方法仅适用于q=2的Wasserstein距离，需要一种能够处理任意近似运输成本（q>1）的更一般方法来计算质心图谱。

Method: 采用一种替代的固定点方法来计算质心图谱，适用于对离群点更加稳健的近似运输成本。

Result: 在持久性图谱距离空间的聚类和字典编码两个应用场景中，证明了该方法所提供的增强的对离群点的稳健性。

Conclusion: 该方法为计算持久性图谱的稳健Wasserstein质心提供了一种通用的解决方案，尤其在需要对离群点更加稳健的应用中显示出其价值。

Abstract: This short paper presents a general approach for computing robust Wasserstein
barycenters of persistence diagrams. The classical method consists in computing
assignment arithmetic means after finding the optimal transport plans between
the barycenter and the persistence diagrams. However, this procedure only works
for the transportation cost related to the $q$-Wasserstein distance $W_q$ when
$q=2$. We adapt an alternative fixed-point method to compute a barycenter
diagram for generic transportation costs ($q > 1$), in particular those robust
to outliers, $q \in (1,2)$. We show the utility of our work in two
applications: \emph{(i)} the clustering of persistence diagrams on their metric
space and \emph{(ii)} the dictionary encoding of persistence diagrams. In both
scenarios, we demonstrate the added robustness to outliers provided by our
generalized framework. Our Python implementation is available at this address:

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods that incorporate deep neural networks
(DNN), though powerful, often lack transparency. Their black-box characteristic
hinders interpretability and reduces trustworthiness, particularly in critical
domains. To address this challenge in RL tasks, we propose a solution based on
Self-Explaining Neural Networks (SENNs) along with explanation extraction
methods to enhance interpretability while maintaining predictive accuracy. Our
approach targets low-dimensionality problems to generate robust local and
global explanations of the model's behaviour. We evaluate the proposed method
on the resource allocation problem in mobile networks, demonstrating that SENNs
can constitute interpretable solutions with competitive performance. This work
highlights the potential of SENNs to improve transparency and trust in
AI-driven decision-making for low-dimensional tasks. Our approach strong
performance on par with the existing state-of-the-art methods, while providing
robust explanations.

Motivation: 现有时间序列预测方法在利用外生变量时存在两大问题：无法利用未来外生变量，以及忽视内生变量与外生变量之间的因果关系，导致预测性能不佳。

Method: 提出DAG双重因果网络框架，包含时间因果模块和通道因果模块。时间因果模块通过因果发现捕捉历史外生变量对未来外生变量的影响，并将因果关系注入到预测中；通道因果模块模型历史外生变量对历史内生变量的影响，并利用这些关系促进基于未来外生变量的预测。

Conclusion: DAG框架通过将因果关系模型化并注入到预测过程中，有效解决了现有时间序列预测方法在利用外生变量旹的两大缺陷，为更准确的预测提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Time series forecasting is crucial in various fields such as economics,
traffic, and AIOps. However, in real-world applications, focusing solely on the
endogenous variables (i.e., target variables), is often insufficient to ensure
accurate predictions. Considering exogenous variables (i.e., covariates)
provides additional predictive information, thereby improving forecasting
accuracy. However, existing methods for time series forecasting with exogenous
variables (TSF-X) have the following shortcomings: 1) they do not leverage
future exogenous variables, 2) they fail to account for the causal
relationships between endogenous and exogenous variables. As a result, their
performance is suboptimal. In this study, to better leverage exogenous
variables, especially future exogenous variable, we propose a general framework
DAG, which utilizes dual causal network along both the temporal and channel
dimensions for time series forecasting with exogenous variables. Specifically,
we first introduce the Temporal Causal Module, which includes a causal
discovery module to capture how historical exogenous variables affect future
exogenous variables. Following this, we construct a causal injection module
that incorporates the discovered causal relationships into the process of
forecasting future endogenous variables based on historical endogenous
variables. Next, we propose the Channel Causal Module, which follows a similar
design principle. It features a causal discovery module models how historical
exogenous variables influence historical endogenous variables, and a causal
injection module incorporates the discovered relationships to enhance the
prediction of future endogenous variables based on future exogenous variables.

Abstract: Social media has become a key medium of communication in today's society.
This realisation has led to many parties employing artificial users (or bots)
to mislead others into believing untruths or acting in a beneficial manner to
such parties. Sophisticated text generation tools, such as large language
models, have further exacerbated this issue. This paper aims to compare the
effectiveness of bot detection models based on encoder and decoder
transformers. Pipelines are developed to evaluate the performance of these
classifiers, revealing that encoder-based classifiers demonstrate greater
accuracy and robustness. However, decoder-based models showed greater
adaptability through task-specific alignment, suggesting more potential for
generalisation across different use cases in addition to superior observa.
These findings contribute to the ongoing effort to prevent digital environments
being manipulated while protecting the integrity of online discussion.

Conclusion: 考虑社交网络移动性的分层联邦学习框架能有效平衡数据隐私保护和模型性能优化，为资源受限环境下的联邦学习提供了新思路

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) offers a decentralized solution that allows
collaborative local model training and global aggregation, thereby protecting
data privacy. In conventional FL frameworks, data privacy is typically
preserved under the assumption that local data remains absolutely private,
whereas the mobility of clients is frequently neglected in explicit modeling.
In this paper, we propose a hierarchical federated learning framework based on
the social network with mobility namely HFL-SNM that considers both data
sharing among clients and their mobility patterns. Under the constraints of
limited resources, we formulate a joint optimization problem of resource
allocation and client scheduling, which objective is to minimize the energy
consumption of clients during the FL process. In social network, we introduce
the concepts of Effective Data Coverage Rate and Redundant Data Coverage Rate.
We analyze the impact of effective data and redundant data on the model
performance through preliminary experiments. We decouple the optimization
problem into multiple sub-problems, analyze them based on preliminary
experimental results, and propose Dynamic Optimization in Social Network with
Mobility (DO-SNM) algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that our
algorithm achieves superior model performance while significantly reducing
energy consumption, compared to traditional baseline algorithms.

Abstract: Malnutrition among pregnant women is a major public health challenge in
Ethiopia, increasing the risk of adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes.
Traditional statistical approaches often fail to capture the complex and
multidimensional determinants of nutritional status. This study develops a
predictive model using ensemble machine learning techniques, leveraging data
from the Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey (2005-2020), comprising 18,108
records with 30 socio-demographic and health attributes. Data preprocessing
included handling missing values, normalization, and balancing with SMOTE,
followed by feature selection to identify key predictors. Several supervised
ensemble algorithms including XGBoost, Random Forest, CatBoost, and AdaBoost
were applied to classify nutritional status. Among them, the Random Forest
model achieved the best performance, classifying women into four categories
(normal, moderate malnutrition, severe malnutrition, and overnutrition) with
97.87% accuracy, 97.88% precision, 97.87% recall, 97.87% F1-score, and 99.86%
ROC AUC. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of ensemble learning in
capturing hidden patterns from complex datasets and provide timely insights for
early detection of nutritional risks. The results offer practical implications
for healthcare providers, policymakers, and researchers, supporting data-driven
strategies to improve maternal nutrition and health outcomes in Ethiopia.

Motivation: 在许多机器学习应用中（如大语言模型训练和强化学习）存在重尾噪声的偏置随机梯度评估，需要开发能够处理这种噪声的双层优化算法。

Method: 提出嵌套循环标准化随机双层近似算法（N²SBA），通过标准化梯度来应对重尾噪声。该算法适用于上层非凸、下层强凸的双层优化问题。

Result: 在找到ϵ-稳定点时，算法的随机一阶秩称识器（SFO）复杂度为Ω(κ^(7p-3)/(p-1) σ^(p/(p-1)) ϵ^(-(4p-2)/(p-1))，其中κ是条件数，p是噪声的中心矩阶数，σ是噪声水平。在非凸-强凹微分对等优化问题中也实现了更优的复杂度。

Conclusion: 所提出的N²SBA算法能够有效处理重尾噪声下的双层优化问题，并在有界方差特例（p=2）下达到了已知最佳结果。

Abstract: This paper considers the smooth bilevel optimization in which the lower-level
problem is strongly convex and the upper-level problem is possibly nonconvex.
We focus on the stochastic setting that the algorithm can access the unbiased
stochastic gradient evaluation with heavy-tailed noise, which is prevalent in
many machine learning applications such as training large language models and
reinforcement learning. We propose a nested-loop normalized stochastic bilevel
approximation (N$^2$SBA) for finding an $\epsilon$-stationary point with the
stochastic first-order oracle (SFO) complexity of
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\big(\kappa^{\frac{7p-3}{p-1}} \sigma^{\frac{p}{p-1}}
\epsilon^{-\frac{4 p - 2}{p-1}}\big)$, where $\kappa$ is the condition number,
$p\in(1,2]$ is the order of central moment for the noise, and $\sigma$ is the
noise level. Furthermore, we specialize our idea to solve the
nonconvex-strongly-concave minimax optimization problem, achieving an
$\epsilon$-stationary point with the SFO complexity of $\tilde{\mathcal
O}\big(\kappa^{\frac{2p-1}{p-1}} \sigma^{\frac{p}{p-1}}
\epsilon^{-\frac{3p-2}{p-1}}\big)$. All above upper bounds match the best-known
results under the special case of the bounded variance setting, i.e., $p=2$.

Motivation: 随着无线技术发展，需要网络更好地理解物理世界，但部署专用感知硬件成本高且复杂。ISAC被动感知提供了成本效益解决方案，但现有方案多限于单一技术，限制了精度。需要集成多种技术来扩大覆盖范围。

Conclusion: FAWN通过融合多种无线技术，有效提升了ISAC室内场景推断的精度，为智能互联环境提供了可行的感知解决方案。

Abstract: The upcoming generations of wireless technologies promise an era where
everything is interconnected and intelligent. As the need for intelligence
grows, networks must learn to better understand the physical world. However,
deploying dedicated hardware to perceive the environment is not always
feasible, mainly due to costs and/or complexity. Integrated Sensing and
Communication (ISAC) has made a step forward in addressing this challenge.
Within ISAC, passive sensing emerges as a cost-effective solution that reuses
wireless communications to sense the environment, without interfering with
existing communications. Nevertheless, the majority of current solutions are
limited to one technology (mostly Wi-Fi or 5G), constraining the maximum
accuracy reachable. As different technologies work with different spectrums, we
see a necessity in integrating more than one technology to augment the coverage
area. Hence, we take the advantage of ISAC passive sensing, to present FAWN, a
MultiEncoder Fusion-Attention Wave Network for ISAC indoor scene inference.
FAWN is based on the original transformers architecture, to fuse information
from Wi-Fi and 5G, making the network capable of understanding the physical
world without interfering with the current communication. To test our solution,
we have built a prototype and integrated it in a real scenario. Results show
errors below 0.6 m around 84% of times.

Abstract: Attention mechanisms have become a cornerstone in modern neural networks,
driving breakthroughs across diverse domains. However, their application to
graph structured data, where capturing topological connections is essential,
remains underexplored and underperforming compared to Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs), particularly in the graph clustering task. GNN tends to overemphasize
neighborhood aggregation, leading to a homogenization of node representations.
Conversely, Transformer tends to over globalize, highlighting distant nodes at
the expense of meaningful local patterns. This dichotomy raises a key question:
Is attention inherently redundant for unsupervised graph learning? To address
this, we conduct a comprehensive empirical analysis, uncovering the
complementary weaknesses of GNN and Transformer in graph clustering. Motivated
by these insights, we propose the Attentive Graph Clustering Network (AGCN) a
novel architecture that reinterprets the notion that graph is attention. AGCN
directly embeds the attention mechanism into the graph structure, enabling
effective global information extraction while maintaining sensitivity to local
topological cues. Our framework incorporates theoretical analysis to contrast
AGCN behavior with GNN and Transformer and introduces two innovations: (1) a KV
cache mechanism to improve computational efficiency, and (2) a pairwise margin
contrastive loss to boost the discriminative capacity of the attention space.
Extensive experimental results demonstrate that AGCN outperforms
state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Foundation models trained on web-scale data have revolutionized robotics, but
their application to low-level control remains largely limited to behavioral
cloning. Drawing inspiration from the success of the reinforcement learning
stage in fine-tuning large language models, we propose a two-stage
post-training approach for robotics. The first stage, Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT), fine-tunes pretrained foundation models using both: a) behavioral
cloning, and b) steps-to-go prediction objectives. In the second stage,
Self-Improvement, steps-to-go prediction enables the extraction of a
well-shaped reward function and a robust success detector, enabling a fleet of
robots to autonomously practice downstream tasks with minimal human
supervision. Through extensive experiments on real-world and simulated robot
embodiments, our novel post-training recipe unveils significant results on
Embodied Foundation Models. First, we demonstrate that the combination of SFT
and Self-Improvement is significantly more sample-efficient than scaling
imitation data collection for supervised learning, and that it leads to
policies with significantly higher success rates. Further ablations highlight
that the combination of web-scale pretraining and Self-Improvement is the key
to this sample-efficiency. Next, we demonstrate that our proposed combination
uniquely unlocks a capability that current methods cannot achieve: autonomously
practicing and acquiring novel skills that generalize far beyond the behaviors
observed in the imitation learning datasets used during training. These
findings highlight the transformative potential of combining pretrained
foundation models with online Self-Improvement to enable autonomous skill
acquisition in robotics. Our project website can be found at

Result: 在四个非平稳基准测试中，DEER比现有最佳经验回放方法性能提升11.54%

Conclusion: DEER通过有效区分环境变化和策略变化，显著提高了非平稳环境中的强化学习效率

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) in non-stationary environments is challenging, as
changing dynamics and rewards quickly make past experiences outdated.
Traditional experience replay (ER) methods, especially those using TD-error
prioritization, struggle to distinguish between changes caused by the agent's
policy and those from the environment, resulting in inefficient learning under
dynamic conditions. To address this challenge, we propose the Discrepancy of
Environment Dynamics (DoE), a metric that isolates the effects of environment
shifts on value functions. Building on this, we introduce Discrepancy of
Environment Prioritized Experience Replay (DEER), an adaptive ER framework that
prioritizes transitions based on both policy updates and environmental changes.
DEER uses a binary classifier to detect environment changes and applies
distinct prioritization strategies before and after each shift, enabling more
sample-efficient learning. Experiments on four non-stationary benchmarks
demonstrate that DEER further improves the performance of off-policy algorithms
by 11.54 percent compared to the best-performing state-of-the-art ER methods.

Abstract: In this paper, we aim to improve multivariate anomaly detection (AD) by
modeling the \textit{time-varying non-linear spatio-temporal correlations}
found in multivariate time series data . In multivariate time series data, an
anomaly may be indicated by the simultaneous deviation of interrelated time
series from their expected collective behavior, even when no individual time
series exhibits a clearly abnormal pattern on its own. In many existing
approaches, time series variables are assumed to be (conditionally)
independent, which oversimplifies real-world interactions. Our approach
addresses this by modeling joint dependencies in the latent space and
decoupling the modeling of \textit{marginal distributions, temporal dynamics,
and inter-variable dependencies}. We use a transformer encoder to capture
temporal patterns, and to model spatial (inter-variable) dependencies, we fit a
multi-variate likelihood and a copula. The temporal and the spatial components
are trained jointly in a latent space using a self-supervised contrastive
learning objective to learn meaningful feature representations to separate

TL;DR: 提出一个两阶段框架，结合无监督模式提取和可解释预测，用于金融市场的方向性预测，在准确性和可解释性方面都表现优异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决金融方向预测中准确性与可解释性的平衡问题，传统基于人工定义模式的方法泛化能力差，深度学习模型缺乏透明度

Method: 两阶段框架：1) SIMPC进行多变量时间序列分割聚类，提取对振幅缩放和时间扭曲不变的重复模式；2) JISC-Net基于shapelet的分类器，使用模式初始部分预测短期方向运动

Result: 在比特币和三种标普500股票上的实验显示，在12个指标-数据集组合中11个排名第一或第二，持续超越基线方法

Conclusion: 该方法通过揭示驱动预测结果的底层模式结构，实现了透明的决策制定，相比传统深度学习模型提供了可解释的预测依据

Abstract: Directional forecasting in financial markets requires both accuracy and
interpretability. Before the advent of deep learning, interpretable approaches
based on human-defined patterns were prevalent, but their structural vagueness
and scale ambiguity hindered generalization. In contrast, deep learning models
can effectively capture complex dynamics, yet often offer limited transparency.
To bridge this gap, we propose a two-stage framework that integrates
unsupervised pattern extracion with interpretable forecasting. (i) SIMPC
segments and clusters multivariate time series, extracting recurrent patterns
that are invariant to amplitude scaling and temporal distortion, even under
varying window sizes. (ii) JISC-Net is a shapelet-based classifier that uses
the initial part of extracted patterns as input and forecasts subsequent
partial sequences for short-term directional movement. Experiments on Bitcoin
and three S&P 500 equities demonstrate that our method ranks first or second in
11 out of 12 metric--dataset combinations, consistently outperforming
baselines. Unlike conventional deep learning models that output buy-or-sell
signals without interpretable justification, our approach enables transparent
decision-making by revealing the underlying pattern structures that drive
predictive outcomes.

Result: 混合方法实现了对规则对手70%以上的稳定胜率，显著优于纯强化学习方法（后者表现出高方差和频繁性能退化）

Conclusion: 演示数据初始化与强化学习优化相结合的方法为复杂多智能体环境中的游戏AI开发提供了稳健解决方案，特别是在纯探索不足的情况下

Abstract: Reinforcement learning agents in complex game environments often suffer from
sparse rewards, training instability, and poor sample efficiency. This paper
presents a hybrid training approach that combines offline imitation learning
with online reinforcement learning for a 2D shooter game agent. We implement a
multi-head neural network with separate outputs for behavioral cloning and
Q-learning, unified by shared feature extraction layers with attention
mechanisms. Initial experiments using pure deep Q-Networks exhibited
significant instability, with agents frequently reverting to poor policies
despite occasional good performance. To address this, we developed a hybrid
methodology that begins with behavioral cloning on demonstration data from
rule-based agents, then transitions to reinforcement learning. Our hybrid
approach achieves consistently above 70% win rate against rule-based opponents,
substantially outperforming pure reinforcement learning methods which showed
high variance and frequent performance degradation. The multi-head architecture
enables effective knowledge transfer between learning modes while maintaining
training stability. Results demonstrate that combining demonstration-based
initialization with reinforcement learning optimization provides a robust
solution for developing game AI agents in complex multi-agent environments
where pure exploration proves insufficient.

Conclusion: 这种组合方法为基于数据集内在特征(包括输入输出维度)的广义元学习和模型优化提供了前进路径

Abstract: This paper develops alternative hyperparameters for specifying sparse
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). These hyperparameters allow for varying
sparsity within the trainable weight matrices of the model while improving
overall performance. This architecture enables the definition of a novel
metric, hidden proportion, which seeks to balance the distribution of unknowns

performance. Together, the use of the varied sparsity RNN architecture combined
with the hidden proportion metric generates significant performance gains while
improving performance expectations on an a priori basis. This combined approach
provides a path forward towards generalized meta-learning applications and
model optimization based on intrinsic characteristics of the data set,
including input and output dimensions.

TL;DR: 提出了基于注意力的双重压缩（ADC）框架，通过两种并行压缩策略显著减少Split Learning中Vision Transformers中间激活值的通信开销，同时保持高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Split Learning训练过程中传输Vision Transformers中间激活值会产生巨大的通信开销，需要开发通信高效的解决方案。

Method: 采用两种并行压缩策略：1）基于注意力分数合并相似样本的激活值（类无关方式）；2）丢弃最无意义的token进一步减少通信成本。两种策略结合实现前向和反向传播的自然压缩。

Result: 仿真结果表明ADC框架显著降低了通信开销，同时保持了高精度，优于现有的最先进Split Learning框架。

Conclusion: ADC框架通过创新的双重压缩策略有效解决了Split Learning中的通信瓶颈问题，为Vision Transformers的高效分布式训练提供了可行方案。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel communication-efficient Split Learning (SL)
framework, named Attention-based Double Compression (ADC), which reduces the
communication overhead required for transmitting intermediate Vision
Transformers activations during the SL training process. ADC incorporates two
parallel compression strategies. The first one merges samples' activations that
are similar, based on the average attention score calculated in the last client
layer; this strategy is class-agnostic, meaning that it can also merge samples
having different classes, without losing generalization ability nor decreasing
final results. The second strategy follows the first and discards the least
meaningful tokens, further reducing the communication cost. Combining these
strategies not only allows for sending less during the forward pass, but also
the gradients are naturally compressed, allowing the whole model to be trained
without additional tuning or approximations of the gradients. Simulation
results demonstrate that Attention-based Double Compression outperforms
state-of-the-art SL frameworks by significantly reducing communication
overheads while maintaining high accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决ℓ0正则化回归中蒙特卡洛方法收敛慢的问题，并探索非线性压缩感知中参数恢复的理论可能性与实际限制。

Method: 采用平滑概率重构ℓ0正则化，实现精确梯度计算；基于Fefferman和Markel定理分析非线性压缩感知的理论界限；实现正规形式算法进行对称类选择。

Result: 新方法比蒙特卡洛方法收敛更快，在广泛设置下优于IHT和Lasso等算法；理论上无限数据极限下可实现对称性恢复，但实证显示参数精确恢复不可行，存在反弹效应。

Conclusion: 该方法为ℓ0正则化提供了高效解决方案，同时揭示了非线性压缩感知与线性情况的根本差异，参数精确恢复存在理论界限。

Abstract: We present a smooth probabilistic reformulation of $\ell_0$ regularized
regression that does not require Monte Carlo sampling and allows for the
computation of exact gradients, facilitating rapid convergence to local optima
of the best subset selection problem. The method drastically improves
convergence speed compared to similar Monte Carlo based approaches.
Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that it outperforms compressive sensing
algorithms such as IHT and (Relaxed-) Lasso across a wide range of settings and
signal-to-noise ratios. The implementation runs efficiently on both CPUs and
GPUs and is freely available at
https://github.com/L0-and-behold/probabilistic-nonlinear-cs.
  We also contribute to research on nonlinear generalizations of compressive
sensing by investigating when parameter recovery of a nonlinear teacher network
is possible through compression of a student network. Building upon theorems of
Fefferman and Markel, we show theoretically that the global optimum in the
infinite-data limit enforces recovery up to certain symmetries. For empirical
validation, we implement a normal-form algorithm that selects a canonical
representative within each symmetry class. However, while compression can help
to improve test loss, we find that exact parameter recovery is not even
possible up to symmetries. In particular, we observe a surprising rebound
effect where teacher and student configurations initially converge but
subsequently diverge despite continuous decrease in test loss. These findings
indicate fundamental differences between linear and nonlinear compressive
sensing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 流量矩阵中不同流量序列常有异质性时序行为，导致单一模型预测准确性不高，需要通过聚类技术分组处理

Method: 提出两种聚类策略：源聚类和直方图聚类，将时序模式相似的流量分组，然后使用深度学习模型分别训练每个聚类

Result: 在Abilene和GÉANT数据集上，方法将RMSE分别降低了92%和75%，路由场景中最大链路利用率偏差分别减少18%和21%

Conclusion: 时间序列聚类能够有效提高流量矩阵预测性能，对网络优化应用具有重要实践价值

Abstract: We present a novel framework that leverages time series clustering to improve
internet traffic matrix (TM) prediction using deep learning (DL) models.
Traffic flows within a TM often exhibit diverse temporal behaviors, which can
hinder prediction accuracy when training a single model across all flows. To
address this, we propose two clustering strategies, source clustering and
histogram clustering, that group flows with similar temporal patterns prior to
model training. Clustering creates more homogeneous data subsets, enabling
models to capture underlying patterns more effectively and generalize better
than global prediction approaches that fit a single model to the entire TM.
Compared to existing TM prediction methods, our method reduces RMSE by up to
92\% for Abilene and 75\% for G\'EANT. In routing scenarios, our clustered
predictions also reduce maximum link utilization (MLU) bias by 18\% and 21\%,
respectively, demonstrating the practical benefits of clustering when TMs are
used for network optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Non-stationary multi-armed bandits enable agents to adapt to changing
environments by incorporating mechanisms to detect and respond to shifts in
reward distributions, making them well-suited for dynamic settings. However,
existing approaches typically assume that reward feedback is available at every
round - an assumption that overlooks many real-world scenarios where feedback
is limited. In this paper, we take a significant step forward by introducing a
new model of constrained feedback in non-stationary multi-armed bandits, where
the availability of reward feedback is restricted. We propose the first
prior-free algorithm - that is, one that does not require prior knowledge of
the degree of non-stationarity - that achieves near-optimal dynamic regret in
this setting. Specifically, our algorithm attains a dynamic regret of
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}({K^{1/3} V_T^{1/3} T }/{ B^{1/3}})$, where $T$ is the
number of rounds, $K$ is the number of arms, $B$ is the query budget, and $V_T$
is the variation budget capturing the degree of non-stationarity.

Abstract: Air pollution remains a critical threat to public health and environmental
sustainability, yet conventional monitoring systems are often constrained by
limited spatial coverage and accessibility. This paper proposes an AI-driven
agent that predicts ambient air pollution levels from sky images and
synthesizes realistic visualizations of pollution scenarios using generative
modeling. Our approach combines statistical texture analysis with supervised
learning for pollution classification, and leverages vision-language model
(VLM)-guided image generation to produce interpretable representations of air
quality conditions. The generated visuals simulate varying degrees of
pollution, offering a foundation for user-facing interfaces that improve
transparency and support informed environmental decision-making. These outputs
can be seamlessly integrated into intelligent applications aimed at enhancing
situational awareness and encouraging behavioral responses based on real-time
forecasts. We validate our method using a dataset of urban sky images and
demonstrate its effectiveness in both pollution level estimation and
semantically consistent visual synthesis. The system design further
incorporates human-centered user experience principles to ensure accessibility,
clarity, and public engagement in air quality forecasting. To support scalable
and energy-efficient deployment, future iterations will incorporate a green CNN
architecture enhanced with FPGA-based incremental learning, enabling real-time
inference on edge platforms.

Motivation: 大语言模型在领域特定应用中需要大量领域数据，但数据可能分布在多个组织中。聚合学习提供了隐私保护解决方案，但在LLM上遇到计算挑战，而单一LoRA模块难以处理异质数据

Method: 提出FedLEASE框架：1、基于表征相似性自适应聚类客户，分配咈训练领域特定的LoRA专家；2、引入自适应的top-M混合专家机制，允许客户根据数据特征选择最优的专家数量

Result: 在多样化标准数据集上的广泛实验表明，FedLEASE在异构客户设置中显著超过现有聚合精细调整方法，同时保持通信效率

Conclusion: FedLEASE有效解决了聚合LoRA精细调整中的关键挑战，通过自适应性的专家分配和选择机制，在异构环境下实现了更高的性能和效率

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across
various tasks, but fine-tuning them for domain-specific applications often
requires substantial domain-specific data that may be distributed across
multiple organizations. Federated Learning (FL) offers a privacy-preserving
solution, but faces challenges with computational constraints when applied to
LLMs. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a parameter-efficient
fine-tuning approach, though a single LoRA module often struggles with
heterogeneous data across diverse domains. This paper addresses two critical
challenges in federated LoRA fine-tuning: 1. determining the optimal number and
allocation of LoRA experts across heterogeneous clients, and 2. enabling
clients to selectively utilize these experts based on their specific data
characteristics. We propose FedLEASE (Federated adaptive LoRA Expert Allocation
and SElection), a novel framework that adaptively clusters clients based on
representation similarity to allocate and train domain-specific LoRA experts.
It also introduces an adaptive top-$M$ Mixture-of-Experts mechanism that allows
each client to select the optimal number of utilized experts. Our extensive
experiments on diverse benchmark datasets demonstrate that FedLEASE
significantly outperforms existing federated fine-tuning approaches in
heterogeneous client settings while maintaining communication efficiency.

Motivation: 解决AI系统与人类价值观对齐的根本挑战，探索在无法创建完美对齐模型的情况下，是否仍能通过多个不同错位AI代理的竞争获得对齐效益。

Method: 采用多领导者Stackelberg博弈模型，将贝叶斯说服扩展到多轮对话中，研究不同信息方的战略互动，并进行理论证明和两组实验验证。

Result: 证明在凸包条件下，用户可以获得与完美对齐模型相当的结果；在较弱假设下，非战略用户使用量子响应也能获得接近最优效用；用户选择最佳单个AI后仍能保持接近最优的均衡保证。

Conclusion: 即使没有完美对齐的AI模型，通过增加模型多样性和战略竞争，用户仍能获得接近完美对齐的效益，这为实际AI对齐提供了可行的替代路径。

Abstract: Aligning AI systems with human values remains a fundamental challenge, but
does our inability to create perfectly aligned models preclude obtaining the
benefits of alignment? We study a strategic setting where a human user
interacts with multiple differently misaligned AI agents, none of which are
individually well-aligned. Our key insight is that when the users utility lies
approximately within the convex hull of the agents utilities, a condition that
becomes easier to satisfy as model diversity increases, strategic competition
can yield outcomes comparable to interacting with a perfectly aligned model. We
model this as a multi-leader Stackelberg game, extending Bayesian persuasion to
multi-round conversations between differently informed parties, and prove three
results: (1) when perfect alignment would allow the user to learn her
Bayes-optimal action, she can also do so in all equilibria under the convex
hull condition (2) under weaker assumptions requiring only approximate utility
learning, a non-strategic user employing quantal response achieves near-optimal
utility in all equilibria and (3) when the user selects the best single AI
after an evaluation period, equilibrium guarantees remain near-optimal without
further distributional assumptions. We complement the theory with two sets of
experiments.

Conclusion: 该混合框架通过分层优化和硬件加速，有效解决了大规模深度学习的能消问题，提高了AI系统的可持续性和可扩展性

Abstract: The rising computational and energy demands of deep learning, particularly in
large-scale architectures such as foundation models and large language models
(LLMs), pose significant challenges to sustainability. Traditional
gradient-based training methods are inefficient, requiring numerous iterative
updates and high power consumption. To address these limitations, we propose a
hybrid framework that combines hierarchical decomposition with FPGA-based
direct equation solving and incremental learning. Our method divides the neural
network into two functional tiers: lower layers are optimized via single-step
equation solving on FPGAs for efficient and parallelizable feature extraction,
while higher layers employ adaptive incremental learning to support continual
updates without full retraining. Building upon this foundation, we introduce
the Compound LLM framework, which explicitly deploys LLM modules across both
hierarchy levels. The lower-level LLM handles reusable representation learning
with minimal energy overhead, while the upper-level LLM performs adaptive
decision-making through energy-aware updates. This integrated design enhances
scalability, reduces redundant computation, and aligns with the principles of
sustainable AI. Theoretical analysis and architectural insights demonstrate
that our method reduces computational costs significantly while preserving high
model performance, making it well-suited for edge deployment and real-time
adaptation in energy-constrained environments.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has shown significant promise in chest radiography,
where deep learning models can approach radiologist-level diagnostic
performance. Progress has been accelerated by large public datasets such as
MIMIC-CXR, ChestX-ray14, PadChest, and CheXpert, which provide hundreds of
thousands of labelled images with pathology annotations. However, these
datasets also present important limitations. Automated label extraction from
radiology reports introduces errors, particularly in handling uncertainty and
negation, and radiologist review frequently disagrees with assigned labels. In
addition, domain shift and population bias restrict model generalisability,
while evaluation practices often overlook clinically meaningful measures. We
conduct a systematic analysis of these challenges, focusing on label quality,
dataset bias, and domain shift. Our cross-dataset domain shift evaluation
across multiple model architectures revealed substantial external performance
degradation, with pronounced reductions in AUPRC and F1 scores relative to
internal testing. To assess dataset bias, we trained a source-classification
model that distinguished datasets with near-perfect accuracy, and performed
subgroup analyses showing reduced performance for minority age and sex groups.
Finally, expert review by two board-certified radiologists identified
significant disagreement with public dataset labels. Our findings highlight
important clinical weaknesses of current benchmarks and emphasise the need for
clinician-validated datasets and fairer evaluation frameworks.

Motivation: 现有奖励模型缺乏时间一致性，导致策略更新无效和强化学习训练不稳定，需要更平滑可靠的奖励模型。

Method: 提出TDRM方法，通过在训练过程中最小化时间差异来学习更平滑的奖励模型，结合时间差分正则化产生平滑奖励并更好对齐长期目标。

Result: TD训练的过程奖励模型在Best-of-N设置中提升6.6%，树搜索设置中提升23.7%。与RLVR结合时，仅需2.5k数据即可达到基线方法50.1k数据的性能，在8个模型变体上获得更高质量的语言模型策略。

Conclusion: TDRM作为可验证奖励方法的补充，能显著提升强化学习的数据效率和策略质量，代码已开源。

Abstract: Reward models are central to both reinforcement learning (RL) with language
models and inference-time verification. However, existing reward models often
lack temporal consistency, leading to ineffective policy updates and unstable
RL training. We introduce TDRM, a method for learning smoother and more
reliable reward models by minimizing temporal differences during training. This
temporal-difference (TD) regularization produces smooth rewards and improves
alignment with long-term objectives. Incorporating TDRM into the actor-critic
style online RL loop yields consistent empirical gains. It is worth noting that
TDRM is a supplement to verifiable reward methods, and both can be used in
series. Experiments show that TD-trained process reward models (PRMs) improve
performance across Best-of-N (up to 6.6%) and tree-search (up to 23.7%)
settings. When combined with Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards
(RLVR), TD-trained PRMs lead to more data-efficient RL -- achieving comparable
performance with just 2.5k data to what baseline methods require 50.1k data to
attain -- and yield higher-quality language model policies on 8 model variants
(5 series), e.g., Qwen2.5-(0.5B, 1,5B), GLM4-9B-0414, GLM-Z1-9B-0414,

Abstract: The growing demand for energy-efficient, high-performance AI systems has led
to increased attention on alternative computing platforms (e.g., photonic,
neuromorphic) due to their potential to accelerate learning and inference.
However, integrating such physical components into deep learning pipelines
remains challenging, as physical devices often offer limited expressiveness,
and their non-differentiable nature renders on-device backpropagation difficult
or infeasible. This motivates the development of hybrid architectures that
combine digital neural networks with reconfigurable physical layers, which
effectively behave as black boxes. In this work, we present a framework for the
end-to-end training of such hybrid networks. This framework integrates
stochastic zeroth-order optimization for updating the physical layer's internal
parameters with a dynamic low-rank surrogate model that enables gradient
propagation through the physical layer. A key component of our approach is the
implicit projector-splitting integrator algorithm, which updates the
lightweight surrogate model after each forward pass with minimal hardware
queries, thereby avoiding costly full matrix reconstruction. We demonstrate our
method across diverse deep learning tasks, including: computer vision, audio
classification, and language modeling. Notably, across all modalities, the
proposed approach achieves near-digital baseline accuracy and consistently
enables effective end-to-end training of hybrid models incorporating various
non-differentiable physical components (spatial light modulators, microring
resonators, and Mach-Zehnder interferometers). This work bridges hardware-aware
deep learning and gradient-free optimization, thereby offering a practical
pathway for integrating non-differentiable physical components into scalable,
end-to-end trainable AI systems.

Motivation: 在高风险场景如医学影像应用中，回归模型的预测需要可靠的置信区间。当校准集包含噪声标签时，现有的Conformal Prediction方法面临挑战。

Method: 首先建立数学基础程序来估计无噪声的CP阈值，然后将其转化为实用算法，解决回归问题连续性的挑战。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了带有噪声标签的回归模型校准问题，为高风险应用提供了更可靠的置信区间估计。

Abstract: In high-stakes scenarios, such as medical imaging applications, it is
critical to equip the predictions of a regression model with reliable
confidence intervals. Recently, Conformal Prediction (CP) has emerged as a
powerful statistical framework that, based on a labeled calibration set,
generates intervals that include the true labels with a pre-specified
probability. In this paper, we address the problem of applying CP for
regression models when the calibration set contains noisy labels. We begin by
establishing a mathematically grounded procedure for estimating the noise-free
CP threshold. Then, we turn it into a practical algorithm that overcomes the
challenges arising from the continuous nature of the regression problem. We
evaluate the proposed method on two medical imaging regression datasets with
Gaussian label noise. Our method significantly outperforms the existing
alternative, achieving performance close to the clean-label setting.

Abstract: Motivated by problems in online advertising, we address the task of Learning
from Label Proportions (LLP). In this partially-supervised setting, training
data consists of groups of examples, termed bags, for which we only observe the
average label value. The main goal, however, remains the design of a predictor
for the labels of individual examples. We introduce a novel and versatile
low-variance de-biasing methodology to learn from aggregate label information,
significantly advancing the state of the art in LLP. Our approach exhibits
remarkable flexibility, seamlessly accommodating a broad spectrum of
practically relevant loss functions across both binary and multi-class
classification settings. By carefully combining our estimators with standard
techniques, we substantially improve sample complexity guarantees for a large
class of losses of practical relevance. We also empirically validate the
efficacy of our proposed approach across a diverse array of benchmark datasets,
demonstrating compelling empirical advantages over standard baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 聚合异质性客户端的信息在对数基于聚合方法中仍然面临挑战，需要更有效的聚合方法来降低通信开销并提高模型性能

Method: 提出了三种对数聚合方法：简单平均、不确定性加权平均和学习式元聚合器，并在MNIST和CIFAR-10数据集上进行评估

Result: 这些方法有效降低了通信开销，在非IID数据下提高了稳健性，并达到了与集中式训练相竞争的准确性

Conclusion: 对数基于聚合方法为大模型聚合式学习提供了高效的解决方案，在保持性能的同时显著减少了通信成本

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) usually shares model weights or gradients, which is
costly for large models. Logit-based FL reduces this cost by sharing only
logits computed on a public proxy dataset. However, aggregating information
from heterogeneous clients is still challenging. This paper studies this
problem, introduces and compares three logit aggregation methods: simple
averaging, uncertainty-weighted averaging, and a learned meta-aggregator.
Evaluated on MNIST and CIFAR-10, these methods reduce communication overhead,
improve robustness under non-IID data, and achieve accuracy competitive with
centralized training.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种主动的数据重写框架，通过保留正确解答并重写错误解答来缩小政策间距，提高了大语言模型的监督精调稳定性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的重要性采样方法在政策间距较大时导致高方差和训练不稳定，而现有方法多为装丝性约束，需要主动缩小政策间距的方法。

Method: 提出一种数据重写框架：保留正确解答作为同策略数据，通过导向重解决重写错误解答，仅在必要时才使用专家示范。这种方法在优化前就对齐训练分布与目标政策。

Result: 在5个数学推理测试集上进行实验，结果显示该方法在一致性和显著性方面都超过了普通SFT和最先进的动态精调(DFT)方法。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的主动数据重写框架能够有效缩小政策间距，降低重要性采样的方差，提高离策精调的稳定性和性能，为大语言模型的监督学习提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of large language models can be viewed as an
off-policy learning problem, where expert demonstrations come from a fixed
behavior policy while training aims to optimize a target policy. Importance
sampling is the standard tool for correcting this distribution mismatch, but
large policy gaps lead to high variance and training instability. Existing
approaches mitigate this issue using KL penalties or clipping, which passively
constrain updates rather than actively reducing the gap. We propose a simple
yet effective data rewriting framework that proactively shrinks the policy gap
by keeping correct solutions as on-policy data and rewriting incorrect ones
with guided re-solving, falling back to expert demonstrations only when needed.
This aligns the training distribution with the target policy before
optimization, reducing importance sampling variance and stabilizing off-policy
fine-tuning. Experiments on five mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate
consistent and significant gains over both vanilla SFT and the state-of-the-art
Dynamic Fine-Tuning (DFT) approach. The data and code will be released at
https://github.com/NKU-HLT/Off-Policy-SFT.

Conclusion: MaRVIn框架通过跨层硬件软件协同设计，有效解决了混合精度神经网络在嵌入式处理器上的执行效率问题，为能效优化的深度学习推理提供了可行方案

Abstract: The evolution of quantization and mixed-precision techniques has unlocked new
possibilities for enhancing the speed and energy efficiency of NNs. Several
recent studies indicate that adapting precision levels across different
parameters can maintain accuracy comparable to full-precision models while
significantly reducing computational demands. However, existing embedded
microprocessors lack sufficient architectural support for efficiently executing
mixed-precision NNs, both in terms of ISA extensions and hardware design,
resulting in inefficiencies such as excessive data packing/unpacking and
underutilized arithmetic units. In this work, we propose novel ISA extensions
and a micro-architecture implementation specifically designed to optimize
mixed-precision execution, enabling energy-efficient deep learning inference on
RISC-V architectures. We introduce MaRVIn, a cross-layer hardware-software
co-design framework that enhances power efficiency and performance through a
combination of hardware improvements, mixed-precision quantization, ISA-level
optimizations, and cycle-accurate emulation. At the hardware level, we enhance
the ALU with configurable mixed-precision arithmetic (2, 4, 8 bits) for
weights/activations and employ multi-pumping to reduce execution latency while
implementing soft SIMD for efficient 2-bit ops. At the software level, we
integrate a pruning-aware fine-tuning method to optimize model compression and
a greedy-based DSE approach to efficiently search for Pareto-optimal
mixed-quantized models. Additionally, we incorporate voltage scaling to boost
the power efficiency of our system. Our experimental evaluation over widely
used DNNs and datasets, such as CIFAR10 and ImageNet, demonstrates that our
framework can achieve, on average, 17.6x speedup for less than 1% accuracy loss
and outperforms the ISA-agnostic state-of-the-art RISC-V cores, delivering up
to 1.8 TOPs/W.

TL;DR: EVOL-RL是一种无需标签的强化学习方法，通过结合多数投票稳定性与语义空间新颖性奖励，防止语言模型在自改进过程中出现熵崩溃，保持探索能力和泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无标签方法（如置信度最小化、自一致性或多数投票目标）虽然稳定学习但会逐渐缩小探索空间，导致熵崩溃问题——生成内容变短、多样性降低且脆弱。需要一种既能实现通用改进又不牺牲模型固有探索能力和泛化能力的方法。

Method: 提出EVOL-RL方法：1）使用多数投票答案作为稳定锚点（选择）；2）添加新颖性感知奖励，在语义空间中偏好与已生成内容不同的回答（变异）；3）采用GRPO实现，使用非对称裁剪保留强信号和熵正则化器维持搜索。

Result: EVOL-RL显著优于多数投票TTRL基线：在无标签AIME24上训练，Qwen3-4B-Base模型在AIME25上的pass@1从4.6%提升至16.4%，pass@16从18.5%提升至37.9%。同时防止多样性崩溃，在跨域（如GPQA）上展现更强泛化能力，在RLVR设置中也提升性能。

Conclusion: EVOL-RL通过选择-变异耦合设计有效解决了无标签强化学习中的熵崩溃问题，不仅保持生成长度和思维链信息量，还提升了模型性能，具有广泛的适用性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained with reinforcement
learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR), yet real-world deployment demands
models that can self-improve without labels or external judges. Existing
label-free methods, confidence minimization, self-consistency, or majority-vote
objectives, stabilize learning but steadily shrink exploration, causing an
entropy collapse: generations become shorter, less diverse, and brittle. Unlike
prior approaches such as Test-Time Reinforcement Learning (TTRL), which
primarily adapt models to the immediate unlabeled dataset at hand, our goal is
broader: to enable general improvements without sacrificing the model's
inherent exploration capacity and generalization ability, i.e., evolving. We
formalize this issue and propose EVolution-Oriented and Label-free
Reinforcement Learning (EVOL-RL), a simple rule that couples stability with
variation under a label-free setting. EVOL-RL keeps the majority-voted answer
as a stable anchor (selection) while adding a novelty-aware reward that favors
responses whose reasoning differs from what has already been produced
(variation), measured in semantic space. Implemented with GRPO, EVOL-RL also
uses asymmetric clipping to preserve strong signals and an entropy regularizer
to sustain search. This majority-for-selection + novelty-for-variation design
prevents collapse, maintains longer and more informative chains of thought, and
improves both pass@1 and pass@n. EVOL-RL consistently outperforms the
majority-only TTRL baseline; e.g., training on label-free AIME24 lifts
Qwen3-4B-Base AIME25 pass@1 from TTRL's 4.6% to 16.4%, and pass@16 from 18.5%
to 37.9%. EVOL-RL not only prevents diversity collapse but also unlocks
stronger generalization across domains (e.g., GPQA). Furthermore, we
demonstrate that EVOL-RL also boosts performance in the RLVR setting,
highlighting its broad applicability.

Abstract: Deep learning has significantly advanced electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis,
enabling automatic annotation, disease screening, and prognosis beyond
traditional clinical capabilities. However, understanding these models remains
a challenge, limiting interpretation and gaining knowledge from these
developments. In this work, we propose a novel interpretability method for
convolutional neural networks applied to ECG analysis. Our approach extracts
time-localized clusters from the model's internal representations, segmenting
the ECG according to the learned characteristics while quantifying the
uncertainty of these representations. This allows us to visualize how different
waveform regions contribute to the model's predictions and assess the certainty
of its decisions. By providing a structured and interpretable view of deep
learning models for ECG, our method enhances trust in AI-driven diagnostics and
facilitates the discovery of clinically relevant electrophysiological patterns.

Motivation: 现有因果公平性方法通常需要已知因果模型，或者通过放松假设但牺牲属性关系覆盖度，这限制了实用性和准确性。

Method: 将复杂的因果公平关系提取问题转化为定制的分布估计问题，采用低维边际分解近似联合分布，配合启发式算法解决计算挑战。

Result: 在基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，CausalPre既有效又可扩展，打破了传统认为实现因果公平需要在关系覆盖度和模型假设之间权衡的观念。

Conclusion: CausalPre证明了无需强因果模型假设也能实现有效的因果公平性，为数据库中的公平性解决方案提供了新的可行路径。

Abstract: Causal fairness in databases is crucial to preventing biased and inaccurate
outcomes in downstream tasks. While most prior work assumes a known causal
model, recent efforts relax this assumption by enforcing additional
constraints. However, these approaches often fail to capture broader attribute
relationships that are critical to maintaining utility. This raises a
fundamental question: Can we harness the benefits of causal reasoning to design
efficient and effective fairness solutions without relying on strong
assumptions about the underlying causal model? In this paper, we seek to answer
this question by introducing CausalPre, a scalable and effective
causality-guided data pre-processing framework that guarantees justifiable
fairness, a strong causal notion of fairness. CausalPre extracts causally fair
relationships by reformulating the originally complex and computationally
infeasible extraction task into a tailored distribution estimation problem. To
ensure scalability, CausalPre adopts a carefully crafted variant of
low-dimensional marginal factorization to approximate the joint distribution,
complemented by a heuristic algorithm that efficiently tackles the associated
computational challenge. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets
demonstrate that CausalPre is both effective and scalable, challenging the
conventional belief that achieving causal fairness requires trading off
relationship coverage for relaxed model assumptions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的奖励最大化方法（如PPO和GRPO）倾向于过度优化主导奖励信号，忽视较少出现但有效的推理路径，从而降低多样性

Method: 将标量奖励转换为使用可学习划分函数归一化的目标分布，然后最小化策略与目标分布之间的反向KL散度，实现为流平衡优化方法

Result: 在数学基准测试中平均比GRPO提升10.0%，比PPO提升5.1%，在代码推理任务中表现一致更好

Conclusion: 奖励分布匹配是实现LLM强化学习中高效探索和多样化推理的关键步骤

Abstract: We propose FlowRL: matching the full reward distribution via flow balancing
instead of maximizing rewards in large language model (LLM) reinforcement
learning (RL). Recent advanced reasoning models adopt reward-maximizing methods
(\eg, PPO and GRPO), which tend to over-optimize dominant reward signals while
neglecting less frequent but valid reasoning paths, thus reducing diversity. In
contrast, we transform scalar rewards into a normalized target distribution
using a learnable partition function, and then minimize the reverse KL
divergence between the policy and the target distribution. We implement this
idea as a flow-balanced optimization method that promotes diverse exploration
and generalizable reasoning trajectories. We conduct experiments on math and
code reasoning tasks: FlowRL achieves a significant average improvement of
$10.0\%$ over GRPO and $5.1\%$ over PPO on math benchmarks, and performs
consistently better on code reasoning tasks. These results highlight reward
distribution-matching as a key step toward efficient exploration and diverse
reasoning in LLM reinforcement learning.
