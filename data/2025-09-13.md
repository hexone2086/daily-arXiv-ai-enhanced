### [1] [Recurrence Meets Transformers for Universal Multimodal Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08897)
*Davide Caffagni,Sara Sarto,Marcella Cornia,Lorenzo Baraldi,Rita Cucchiara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReT-2是一个统一的检索模型，支持多模态查询（图像+文本）和跨多模态文档集合的检索，通过循环Transformer架构和门控机制实现跨层跨模态信息整合，在多个基准测试中达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多模态检索在LLMs和多模态LLMs中的快速发展，出现了越来越复杂的检索任务。现有方法主要依赖于视觉-语言模型的任务特定微调，且仅限于单模态查询或文档，无法满足多模态检索需求。

Method: ReT-2采用多层表示和循环Transformer架构，结合LSTM启发的门控机制，动态整合跨层和跨模态信息，捕捉细粒度的视觉和文本细节。

Result: 在M2KR和M-BEIR基准测试中，ReT-2在不同检索配置下始终达到最先进的性能，同时提供更快的推理速度和更低的内存使用。在检索增强生成管道中集成ReT-2还能提升Encyclopedic-VQA和InfoSeek数据集的性能。

Conclusion: ReT-2是一个高效统一的多模态检索模型，支持复杂的多模态查询和检索任务，在性能和效率方面均优于现有方法，为多模态检索领域提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of multimodal retrieval and its application in
LLMs and multimodal LLMs, increasingly complex retrieval tasks have emerged.
Existing methods predominantly rely on task-specific fine-tuning of
vision-language models and are limited to single-modality queries or documents.
In this paper, we propose ReT-2, a unified retrieval model that supports
multimodal queries, composed of both images and text, and searches across
multimodal document collections where text and images coexist. ReT-2 leverages
multi-layer representations and a recurrent Transformer architecture with
LSTM-inspired gating mechanisms to dynamically integrate information across
layers and modalities, capturing fine-grained visual and textual details. We
evaluate ReT-2 on the challenging M2KR and M-BEIR benchmarks across different
retrieval configurations. Results demonstrate that ReT-2 consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance across diverse settings, while offering faster
inference and reduced memory usage compared to prior approaches. When
integrated into retrieval-augmented generation pipelines, ReT-2 also improves
downstream performance on Encyclopedic-VQA and InfoSeek datasets. Our source

### [2] [Diffusion-Based Action Recognition Generalizes to Untrained Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08908)
*Rogerio Guimaraes,Frank Xiao,Pietro Perona,Markus Marks*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 使用视觉扩散模型特征和Transformer实现跨物种、视角和上下文的人类级动作识别泛化能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类能够在物种差异、视角变化和上下文差异等大范围变化下识别相同动作，而当前深度学习模型在此类泛化方面存在困难

Method: 采用视觉扩散模型生成特征，通过Transformer进行聚合，并使用在扩散过程早期时间步条件化的模型来突出语义信息而非像素级细节

Result: 在跨物种动作分类、不同视角和不同记录上下文的泛化基准测试中均达到了新的最先进水平

Conclusion: 该方法使机器动作识别更接近人类级别的鲁棒性，为跨域动作识别提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Humans can recognize the same actions despite large context and viewpoint
variations, such as differences between species (walking in spiders vs.
horses), viewpoints (egocentric vs. third-person), and contexts (real life vs
movies). Current deep learning models struggle with such generalization. We
propose using features generated by a Vision Diffusion Model (VDM), aggregated
via a transformer, to achieve human-like action recognition across these
challenging conditions. We find that generalization is enhanced by the use of a
model conditioned on earlier timesteps of the diffusion process to highlight
semantic information over pixel level details in the extracted features. We
experimentally explore the generalization properties of our approach in
classifying actions across animal species, across different viewing angles, and
different recording contexts. Our model sets a new state-of-the-art across all
three generalization benchmarks, bringing machine action recognition closer to
human-like robustness. Project page:

### [3] [PromptGuard: An Orchestrated Prompting Framework for Principled Synthetic Text Generation for Vulnerable Populations using LLMs with Enhanced Safety, Fairness, and Controllability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08910)
*Tung Vu,Lam Nguyen,Quynh Dao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PromptGuard是一个模块化提示框架，通过VulnGuard Prompt技术使用对比学习防止LLM生成有害信息，特别保护LGBTQ+、单亲家庭等弱势群体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全方法依赖事后过滤或通用对齐技术，无法在生成源头主动防止有害输出，特别是对弱势群体造成伤害的风险。

Method: 提出PromptGuard框架，包含VulnGuard Prompt混合技术，整合GitHub数据驱动的对比学习、少样本示例、伦理思维链推理和自适应角色提示，采用多目标优化理论。

Result: 通过熵界和帕累托最优性证明可实现25-30%的分析性伤害减少，建立了系统实证研究的数学基础。

Conclusion: PromptGuard提供了一个智能专家系统，通过六个核心模块实现实时伤害预防，为LLM安全保护弱势群体提供了理论框架和实践方案。

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in real-world applications
poses unprecedented risks of generating harmful, biased, or misleading
information to vulnerable populations including LGBTQ+ individuals, single
parents, and marginalized communities. While existing safety approaches rely on
post-hoc filtering or generic alignment techniques, they fail to proactively
prevent harmful outputs at the generation source. This paper introduces
PromptGuard, a novel modular prompting framework with our breakthrough
contribution: VulnGuard Prompt, a hybrid technique that prevents harmful
information generation using real-world data-driven contrastive learning.
VulnGuard integrates few-shot examples from curated GitHub repositories,
ethical chain-of-thought reasoning, and adaptive role-prompting to create
population-specific protective barriers. Our framework employs theoretical
multi-objective optimization with formal proofs demonstrating 25-30% analytical
harm reduction through entropy bounds and Pareto optimality. PromptGuard
orchestrates six core modules: Input Classification, VulnGuard Prompting,
Ethical Principles Integration, External Tool Interaction, Output Validation,
and User-System Interaction, creating an intelligent expert system for
real-time harm prevention. We provide comprehensive mathematical formalization
including convergence proofs, vulnerability analysis using information theory,
and theoretical validation framework using GitHub-sourced datasets,
establishing mathematical foundations for systematic empirical research.

### [4] [Similarity-based Outlier Detection for Noisy Object Re-Identification Using Beta Mixtures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08926)
*Waqar Ahmad,Evan Murphy,Vladimir A. Krylov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Beta-SOD方法，通过Beta混合分布建模相似度分布来检测标签噪声，提升Re-ID在噪声环境下的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Re-ID方法对标签噪声高度敏感，传统方法在噪声环境下性能显著下降，需要开发鲁棒的噪声处理方案

Method: 采用孪生网络架构，结合二元交叉熵、对比损失和余弦嵌入损失；提出Beta-SOD统计异常检测框架，使用双分量Beta混合分布建模嵌入对之间的余弦相似度分布

Result: 在CUHK03、Market-1501和VeRi-776数据集上，在10-30%噪声水平下均优于现有最先进方法，表现出鲁棒性和广泛适用性

Conclusion: Beta-SOD通过统计建模相似度分布有效处理Re-ID中的标签噪声问题，为噪声环境下的Re-ID任务提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Object re-identification (Re-ID) methods are highly sensitive to label noise,
which typically leads to significant performance degradation. We address this
challenge by reframing Re-ID as a supervised image similarity task and adopting
a Siamese network architecture trained to capture discriminative pairwise
relationships. Central to our approach is a novel statistical outlier detection
(OD) framework, termed Beta-SOD (Beta mixture Similarity-based Outlier
Detection), which models the distribution of cosine similarities between
embedding pairs using a two-component Beta distribution mixture model. We
establish a novel identifiability result for mixtures of two Beta
distributions, ensuring that our learning task is well-posed.The proposed OD
step complements the Re-ID architecture combining binary cross-entropy,
contrastive, and cosine embedding losses that jointly optimize feature-level
similarity learning.We demonstrate the effectiveness of Beta-SOD in de-noising
and Re-ID tasks for person Re-ID, on CUHK03 and Market-1501 datasets, and
vehicle Re-ID, on VeRi-776 dataset. Our method shows superior performance
compared to the state-of-the-art methods across various noise levels (10-30\%),
demonstrating both robustness and broad applicability in noisy Re-ID scenarios.

### [5] [SFD-Mamba2Net: Strcture-Guided Frequency-Enhanced Dual-Stream Mamba2 Network for Coronary Artery Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08934)
*Nan Mu,Ruiqi Song,Zhihui Xu,Jingfeng Jiang,Chen Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SFD-Mamba2Net是一个端到端框架，通过整合多尺度结构先验、状态空间长程依赖建模和频域细节增强策略，显著提升了ICA图像中冠状动脉分割和狭窄检测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冠状动脉疾病是全球主要死因之一，侵入性冠状动脉造影（ICA）作为金标准诊断方法，但ICA图像存在低对比度、高噪声和复杂血管结构等挑战，现有分割检测方法临床采用困难。

Method: 提出SFD-Mamba2Net框架：编码器嵌入曲率感知结构增强（CASE）模块，利用多尺度响应突出管状血管结构；解码器引入渐进高频感知（PHFP）模块，通过多级小波分解逐步细化高频细节并整合低频全局结构。

Result: 在八个分割指标上均优于最先进方法，在狭窄检测中实现了最高的真阳性率和阳性预测值。

Conclusion: 该方法通过结构增强和频域细节优化，有效解决了ICA图像血管分割和狭窄检测的挑战，为临床诊断提供了更准确的工具。

Abstract: Background: Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is one of the leading causes of
death worldwide. Invasive Coronary Angiography (ICA), regarded as the gold
standard for CAD diagnosis, necessitates precise vessel segmentation and
stenosis detection. However, ICA images are typically characterized by low
contrast, high noise levels, and complex, fine-grained vascular structures,
which pose significant challenges to the clinical adoption of existing
segmentation and detection methods. Objective: This study aims to improve the
accuracy of coronary artery segmentation and stenosis detection in ICA images
by integrating multi-scale structural priors, state-space-based long-range
dependency modeling, and frequency-domain detail enhancement strategies.
Methods: We propose SFD-Mamba2Net, an end-to-end framework tailored for
ICA-based vascular segmentation and stenosis detection. In the encoder, a
Curvature-Aware Structural Enhancement (CASE) module is embedded to leverage
multi-scale responses for highlighting slender tubular vascular structures,
suppressing background interference, and directing attention toward vascular
regions. In the decoder, we introduce a Progressive High-Frequency Perception
(PHFP) module that employs multi-level wavelet decomposition to progressively
refine high-frequency details while integrating low-frequency global
structures. Results and Conclusions: SFD-Mamba2Net consistently outperformed
state-of-the-art methods across eight segmentation metrics, and achieved the
highest true positive rate and positive predictive value in stenosis detection.

### [6] [Live(r) Die: Predicting Survival in Colorectal Liver Metastasis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08935)
*Muhammad Alberb,Helen Cheung,Anne Martel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一个全自动化桌面用于预测结直肠癌肝转移手术结果的框架，结合MRI图像分割和收音学特征分析，预测准确性超过现有临床和基因标记物超10%以上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结直肠癌肝转移导致生存率显著下降，而现有预后模型预测能力不足，特别是在多发性肝转移情况下。需要更准确的手术结果预测方法。

Method: 框架包括两个流水线：分割流水线利用基础模型完善部分注释数据，提出SAMONAI算法实现单点提示三维分割；收音学流水线提取肿瘤特征，使用SurvAMINN网络进行生存分析，聚焦最具攻击性肿瘤。

Result: 在227名患者的机构数据集上进行了评估，该框架的C指数提升超过10%，表现超过现有所有临床和基因标记物。

Conclusion: 研究证明了自动化分割算法与收音学生存分析的集成可以为结直肠癌肝转移提供准确、注释效率高且可解释的结果预测。

Abstract: Colorectal cancer frequently metastasizes to the liver, significantly
reducing long-term survival. While surgical resection is the only potentially
curative treatment for colorectal liver metastasis (CRLM), patient outcomes
vary widely depending on tumor characteristics along with clinical and genomic
factors. Current prognostic models, often based on limited clinical or
molecular features, lack sufficient predictive power, especially in multifocal
CRLM cases. We present a fully automated framework for surgical outcome
prediction from pre- and post-contrast MRI acquired before surgery. Our
framework consists of a segmentation pipeline and a radiomics pipeline. The
segmentation pipeline learns to segment the liver, tumors, and spleen from
partially annotated data by leveraging promptable foundation models to complete
missing labels. Also, we propose SAMONAI, a novel zero-shot 3D prompt
propagation algorithm that leverages the Segment Anything Model to segment 3D
regions of interest from a single point prompt, significantly improving our
segmentation pipeline's accuracy and efficiency. The predicted pre- and
post-contrast segmentations are then fed into our radiomics pipeline, which
extracts features from each tumor and predicts survival using SurvAMINN, a
novel autoencoder-based multiple instance neural network for survival analysis.
SurvAMINN jointly learns dimensionality reduction and hazard prediction from
right-censored survival data, focusing on the most aggressive tumors. Extensive
evaluation on an institutional dataset comprising 227 patients demonstrates
that our framework surpasses existing clinical and genomic biomarkers,
delivering a C-index improvement exceeding 10%. Our results demonstrate the
potential of integrating automated segmentation algorithms and radiomics-based
survival analysis to deliver accurate, annotation-efficient, and interpretable
outcome prediction in CRLM.

*Lisa Dunlap,Joseph E. Gonzalez,Trevor Darrell,Fabian Caba Heilbron,Josef Sivic,Bryan Russell*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CompCon算法通过进化搜索发现不同文本到图像模型输出中的视觉属性差异，并找到触发这些差异的提示概念


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究不同生成模型学习到的视觉表示何时以及如何出现分歧，发现一个模型产生而另一个模型不产生的视觉属性及其触发提示

Method: 引入CompCon进化搜索算法，创建自动化数据生成管道产生ID2数据集，与多种LLM和VLM基线方法进行比较

Result: 成功发现模型间的表示差异，如PixArt在孤独提示中描绘湿街道，Stable Diffusion 3.5在媒体职业中描绘非裔美国人

Conclusion: CompCon能有效识别文本到图像模型间的视觉表示差异，为模型比较和理解提供了新工具

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate when and how visual representations learned by
two different generative models diverge. Given two text-to-image models, our
goal is to discover visual attributes that appear in images generated by one
model but not the other, along with the types of prompts that trigger these
attribute differences. For example, "flames" might appear in one model's
outputs when given prompts expressing strong emotions, while the other model
does not produce this attribute given the same prompts. We introduce CompCon
(Comparing Concepts), an evolutionary search algorithm that discovers visual
attributes more prevalent in one model's output than the other, and uncovers
the prompt concepts linked to these visual differences. To evaluate CompCon's
ability to find diverging representations, we create an automated data
generation pipeline to produce ID2, a dataset of 60 input-dependent
differences, and compare our approach to several LLM- and VLM-powered
baselines. Finally, we use CompCon to compare popular text-to-image models,
finding divergent representations such as how PixArt depicts prompts mentioning
loneliness with wet streets and Stable Diffusion 3.5 depicts African American
people in media professions. Code at: https://github.com/adobe-research/CompCon

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于U-Net的深度学习模型来识别和修复无人机图像中的云影和太阳耀斑区域，以提高水质参数估计的准确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机遥感图像在云层条件下仍可获取，但常受云影和太阳耀斑污染，严重影响水质参数估计精度

Method: 使用像素级数据训练U-Net深度学习模型，通过评估指标确定最佳训练设置，建立高质量图像校正模型

Result: 开发出能够有效识别和提取云影、太阳耀斑区域，并恢复这些区域图像质量的校正模型

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了无人机图像中云影和太阳耀斑的问题，为水质遥感监测提供了可靠的技术支持

Abstract: The use of unmanned aerial systems (UASs) has increased tremendously in the
current decade. They have significantly advanced remote sensing with the
capability to deploy and image the terrain as per required spatial, spectral,
temporal, and radiometric resolutions for various remote sensing applications.
One of the major advantages of UAS imagery is that images can be acquired in
cloudy conditions by flying the UAS under the clouds. The limitation to the
technology is that the imagery is often sullied by cloud shadows. Images taken
over water are additionally affected by sun glint. These are two pose serious
issues for estimating water quality parameters from the UAS images. This study
proposes a novel machine learning approach first to identify and extract
regions with cloud shadows and sun glint and separate such regions from
non-obstructed clear sky regions and sun-glint unaffected regions. The data was
extracted from the images at pixel level to train an U-Net based deep learning
model and best settings for model training was identified based on the various
evaluation metrics from test cases. Using this evaluation, a high-quality image
correction model was determined, which was used to recover the cloud shadow and
sun glint areas in the images.

### [9] [CoSwin: Convolution Enhanced Hierarchical Shifted Window Attention For Small-Scale Vision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08959)
*Puskal Khadka,Rodrigue Rizk,Longwei Wang,KC Santosh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoSwin是一种结合卷积局部特征学习和Transformer全局注意力的混合架构，在小规模图像分类数据集上显著提升了性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers在全局上下文建模方面表现出色，但在小数据集上缺乏局部特征提取能力，需要引入局部性和平移等变性等归纳偏置

Method: 提出CoSwin架构，在分层移位窗口注意力机制中集成可学习的局部特征增强模块，同时捕获细粒度空间细节和全局语义结构

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100、MNIST、SVHN和Tiny ImageNet等多个基准测试中均取得性能提升，相比Swin Transformer分别提升2.17%、4.92%、0.10%、0.26%和4.47%

Conclusion: 局部-全局特征融合能有效增强Transformer在小规模视觉任务中的泛化能力和鲁棒性

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved impressive results in computer
vision by leveraging self-attention to model long-range dependencies. However,
their emphasis on global context often comes at the expense of local feature
extraction in small datasets, particularly due to the lack of key inductive
biases such as locality and translation equivariance. To mitigate this, we
propose CoSwin, a novel feature-fusion architecture that augments the
hierarchical shifted window attention with localized convolutional feature
learning. Specifically, CoSwin integrates a learnable local feature enhancement
module into each attention block, enabling the model to simultaneously capture
fine-grained spatial details and global semantic structure. We evaluate CoSwin
on multiple image classification benchmarks including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
MNIST, SVHN, and Tiny ImageNet. Our experimental results show consistent
performance gains over state-of-the-art convolutional and transformer-based
models. Notably, CoSwin achieves improvements of 2.17% on CIFAR-10, 4.92% on
CIFAR-100, 0.10% on MNIST, 0.26% on SVHN, and 4.47% on Tiny ImageNet over the
baseline Swin Transformer. These improvements underscore the effectiveness of
local-global feature fusion in enhancing the generalization and robustness of
transformers for small-scale vision. Code and pretrained weights available at

### [10] [iMatcher: Improve matching in point cloud registration via local-to-global geometric consistency learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08982)
*Karim Slimani,Catherine Achard,Brahim Tamadazte*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: iMatcher是一个完全可微的点云配准特征匹配框架，通过局部图嵌入和全局几何一致性学习预测几何一致的置信矩阵，在多个数据集上实现了最先进的配准性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决点云配准中特征匹配的几何一致性问题，需要开发一个能够同时考虑局部和全局一致性的完全可微框架，以提高配准的准确性和鲁棒性。

Method: 首先使用局部图嵌入模块初始化得分矩阵，然后通过双向最近邻搜索进行重新定位优化，最后通过全局几何一致性学习堆叠配对点特征来预测点级匹配概率。

Result: 在KITTI数据集上达到95%-97%的内点率，KITTI-360上94%-97%，3DMatch上最高81.1%，在多个数据集上显著提升了刚性配准性能。

Conclusion: iMatcher通过结合局部和全局几何一致性学习，在室内外各种点云配准任务中都表现出优异的性能，证明了其方法的有效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: This paper presents iMatcher, a fully differentiable framework for feature
matching in point cloud registration. The proposed method leverages learned
features to predict a geometrically consistent confidence matrix, incorporating
both local and global consistency. First, a local graph embedding module leads
to an initialization of the score matrix. A subsequent repositioning step
refines this matrix by considering bilateral source-to-target and
target-to-source matching via nearest neighbor search in 3D space. The paired
point features are then stacked together to be refined through global geometric
consistency learning to predict a point-wise matching probability. Extensive
experiments on real-world outdoor (KITTI, KITTI-360) and indoor (3DMatch)
datasets, as well as on 6-DoF pose estimation (TUD-L) and partial-to-partial
matching (MVP-RG), demonstrate that iMatcher significantly improves rigid
registration performance. The method achieves state-of-the-art inlier ratios,
scoring 95% - 97% on KITTI, 94% - 97% on KITTI-360, and up to 81.1% on 3DMatch,
highlighting its robustness across diverse settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出UltrON方法，利用超声B模式图像的声学特征进行弱监督优化，改进3D形状重建，解决遮挡和标注依赖问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于SDF的隐式表示方法依赖精确标注，忽略了B模式图像中的丰富声学信息，且难以处理超声视角依赖性和声影伪影问题

Method: 采用基于占据函数的表示方法，提出UltrON框架，利用B模式图像的声学特征，设计新的损失函数补偿视角依赖性，实现多视角超声的弱监督优化

Result: UltrON能够缓解遮挡和稀疏标注的限制，提高几何一致性，并可泛化到相同解剖结构的不同形状

Conclusion: 该方法为更准确的3D重建开辟了新途径，代码和数据集将开源

Abstract: In free-hand ultrasound imaging, sonographers rely on expertise to mentally
integrate partial 2D views into 3D anatomical shapes. Shape reconstruction can
assist clinicians in this process. Central to this task is the choice of shape
representation, as it determines how accurately and efficiently the structure
can be visualized, analyzed, and interpreted. Implicit representations, such as
SDF and occupancy function, offer a powerful alternative to traditional voxel-
or mesh-based methods by modeling continuous, smooth surfaces with compact
storage, avoiding explicit discretization. Recent studies demonstrate that SDF
can be effectively optimized using annotations derived from segmented B-mode
ultrasound images. Yet, these approaches hinge on precise annotations,
overlooking the rich acoustic information embedded in B-mode intensity.
Moreover, implicit representation approaches struggle with the ultrasound's
view-dependent nature and acoustic shadowing artifacts, which impair
reconstruction. To address the problems resulting from occlusions and
annotation dependency, we propose an occupancy-based representation and
introduce \gls{UltrON} that leverages acoustic features to improve geometric
consistency in weakly-supervised optimization regime. We show that these
features can be obtained from B-mode images without additional annotation cost.
Moreover, we propose a novel loss function that compensates for view-dependency
in the B-mode images and facilitates occupancy optimization from multiview
ultrasound. By incorporating acoustic properties, \gls{UltrON} generalizes to
shapes of the same anatomy. We show that \gls{UltrON} mitigates the limitations
of occlusions and sparse labeling and paves the way for more accurate 3D
reconstruction. Code and dataset will be available at

TL;DR: 提出基于隐式神经表示(INR)的方法，无需推理时优化即可预测连续左心室位移，在心肌应变分析中实现最佳精度和速度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动量化心肌内运动和应变从标记MRI仍然是一个重要但具有挑战性的任务，需要准确且可扩展的解决方案

Method: 使用隐式神经表示(INR)结合学习到的潜在编码来预测连续左心室位移，无需推理时优化

Result: 在452个UK Biobank测试案例中，实现了最佳跟踪精度(2.14 mm RMSE)和最低的全局周向应变(2.86%)与径向应变(6.42%)组合误差，比最准确基线快约380倍

Conclusion: 基于INR的模型适合在大规模CMR数据集中进行准确且可扩展的心肌应变分析

Abstract: Automatic quantification of intramyocardial motion and strain from tagging
MRI remains an important but challenging task. We propose a method using
implicit neural representations (INRs), conditioned on learned latent codes, to
predict continuous left ventricular (LV) displacement -- without requiring
inference-time optimisation. Evaluated on 452 UK Biobank test cases, our method
achieved the best tracking accuracy (2.14 mm RMSE) and the lowest combined
error in global circumferential (2.86%) and radial (6.42%) strain compared to
three deep learning baselines. In addition, our method is $\sim$380$\times$
faster than the most accurate baseline. These results highlight the suitability
of INR-based models for accurate and scalable analysis of myocardial strain in
large CMR datasets.

*Samuel Felipe dos Santos,Tiago Agostinho de Almeida,Jurandy Almeida*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: E-MLNet通过动态权重策略改进MLNet，在通用域自适应中更精确地区分已知和未知类别，在多个基准测试中表现优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如MLNet对所有分类器平等对待，导致学习信号稀释，需要更聚焦的适应策略来提升已知和未知类别的区分能力

Method: 提出增强型互学习网络(E-MLNet)，集成动态权重策略到开放集熵最小化(OEM)中，利用闭集分类器预测来聚焦最相关的类别边界

Result: 在Office-31、Office-Home、VisDA-2017和ImageCLEF四个基准测试中，E-MLNet在VisDA和ImageCLEF上获得最高平均H分数，在31个任务中22个开放部分DA和19个开放集DA任务上优于MLNet基线

Conclusion: 动态权重策略有效提升了通用域自适应性能，E-MLNet通过聚焦相关类别边界实现了更鲁棒的已知-未知类别区分

Abstract: Universal Domain Adaptation (UniDA) seeks to transfer knowledge from a
labeled source to an unlabeled target domain without assuming any relationship
between their label sets, requiring models to classify known samples while
rejecting unknown ones. Advanced methods like Mutual Learning Network (MLNet)
use a bank of one-vs-all classifiers adapted via Open-set Entropy Minimization
(OEM). However, this strategy treats all classifiers equally, diluting the
learning signal. We propose the Enhanced Mutual Learning Network (E-MLNet),
which integrates a dynamic weighting strategy to OEM. By leveraging the
closed-set classifier's predictions, E-MLNet focuses adaptation on the most
relevant class boundaries for each target sample, sharpening the distinction
between known and unknown classes. We conduct extensive experiments on four
challenging benchmarks: Office-31, Office-Home, VisDA-2017, and ImageCLEF. The
results demonstrate that E-MLNet achieves the highest average H-scores on VisDA
and ImageCLEF and exhibits superior robustness over its predecessor. E-MLNet
outperforms the strong MLNet baseline in the majority of individual adaptation
tasks -- 22 out of 31 in the challenging Open-Partial DA setting and 19 out of
31 in the Open-Set DA setting -- confirming the benefits of our focused
adaptation strategy.

Result: 构建了包含59,000张图片和319,000个乌尔都语字幕的大规模数据集，在BLEU、SacreBLEU和chrF基准测试中表现优异，是目前最大的公开乌尔都语字幕数据集。

Conclusion: 通过发布数据集和质量评估流程，旨在减少多模态研究中的语言偏见，为包容性视觉语言系统奠定基础，促进乌尔都语在多模态领域的发展。

Abstract: Urdu, spoken by over 250 million people, remains critically under-served in
multimodal and vision-language research. The absence of large-scale,
high-quality datasets has limited the development of Urdu-capable systems and
reinforced biases in multilingual vision-language models trained primarily on
high-resource languages. To address this gap, we present COCO-Urdu, a
large-scale image-caption dataset derived from MS COCO, containing 59,000
images and 319,000 Urdu captions selected through stratified sampling to
preserve the original distribution. Captions were translated using SeamlessM4T
v2 and validated with a hybrid multimodal quality estimation framework that
integrates COMET-Kiwi for translation quality, CLIP-based similarity for visual
grounding, and BERTScore with back-translation for semantic consistency;
low-scoring captions were iteratively refined using open-source large language
models. We further benchmark COCO-Urdu on BLEU, SacreBLEU, and chrF, reporting
consistently strong results. To the best of our knowledge, COCO-Urdu is the
largest publicly available Urdu captioning dataset. By releasing both the
dataset and the quality estimation pipeline, we aim to reduce language bias in
multimodal research and establish a foundation for inclusive vision-language
systems.

Abstract: Recent advances in fMRI-based visual decoding have enabled compelling
reconstructions of perceived images. However, most approaches rely on
subject-specific training, limiting scalability and practical deployment. We
introduce \textbf{VoxelFormer}, a lightweight transformer architecture that
enables multi-subject training for visual decoding from fMRI. VoxelFormer
integrates a Token Merging Transformer (ToMer) for efficient voxel compression
and a query-driven Q-Former that produces fixed-size neural representations
aligned with the CLIP image embedding space. Evaluated on the 7T Natural Scenes
Dataset, VoxelFormer achieves competitive retrieval performance on subjects
included during training with significantly fewer parameters than existing
methods. These results highlight token merging and query-based transformers as
promising strategies for parameter-efficient neural decoding.

TL;DR: 通过提出概率因果图模型(PCGM)方法，在生成式死亡模型中显式集成解剖约束，生成更加解剖可信的3D脑部MRI反事实图像，能够复现疾病对相盾相关相关的细微形态差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D脑部MRI研究需要检测细微的形态学差异，但现有的反事实图像生成模型缺乏显式的解剖偏置，无法保持细细的解剖细节，导致生成的MRI在解剖上不可信。

Method: 提出PCGM方法，通过概率图模块捐捕解剖约束，并将其转换为空间二进制掩码来标记细微变化区域。使用3D ControlNet编码掩码，约束新的反事实去噪UNet，最终通过3D死亡解码器生成高质量的脑部MRI。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，PCGM生成的结构脑部MRI质量高于多个基线方法。更重要的是，PCGM生成的反事实图像能够复现神经科学文献中报告过的疾病对相盾相关相关的细微影响。

Conclusion: PCGM方法在生成解剖可信的3D脑部反事实MRI方面取得了重要进展，为研究细微形态学差异的合成MRI应用标记了重要里程碑。

Abstract: 3D brain MRI studies often examine subtle morphometric differences between
cohorts that are hard to detect visually. Given the high cost of MRI
acquisition, these studies could greatly benefit from image syntheses,
particularly counterfactual image generation, as seen in other domains, such as
computer vision. However, counterfactual models struggle to produce
anatomically plausible MRIs due to the lack of explicit inductive biases to
preserve fine-grained anatomical details. This shortcoming arises from the
training of the models aiming to optimize for the overall appearance of the
images (e.g., via cross-entropy) rather than preserving subtle, yet medically
relevant, local variations across subjects. To preserve subtle variations, we
propose to explicitly integrate anatomical constraints on a voxel-level as
prior into a generative diffusion framework. Called Probabilistic Causal Graph
Model (PCGM), the approach captures anatomical constraints via a probabilistic
graph module and translates those constraints into spatial binary masks of
regions where subtle variations occur. The masks (encoded by a 3D extension of
ControlNet) constrain a novel counterfactual denoising UNet, whose encodings
are then transferred into high-quality brain MRIs via our 3D diffusion decoder.
Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that PCGM generates
structural brain MRIs of higher quality than several baseline approaches.
Furthermore, we show for the first time that brain measurements extracted from
counterfactuals (generated by PCGM) replicate the subtle effects of a disease
on cortical brain regions previously reported in the neuroscience literature.
This achievement is an important milestone in the use of synthetic MRIs in
studies investigating subtle morphological differences.

Motivation: 传统闭集检测器在域偏移和飞行数据损坏情况下性能显著下降，对安全关键应用构成风险，需要开发能够处理未知对象的鲁棒检测方法。

Method: 基于嵌入的检测器，通过嵌入空间熵建模估计语义不确定性，结合谱归一化和温度缩放来增强开放式识别能力，并采用背景拒绝机制。

Result: 在AOT空中基准测试和真实飞行测试中验证，相比标准YOLO检测器获得高达10%的相对AUROC提升，背景拒绝在不影响检测精度的情况下进一步增强了鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该框架特别适用于动态空对空环境中的可靠无人机感知，为安全关键应用提供了有效的开放式检测解决方案。

Abstract: Open-set detection is crucial for robust UAV autonomy in air-to-air object
detection under real-world conditions. Traditional closed-set detectors degrade
significantly under domain shifts and flight data corruption, posing risks to
safety-critical applications. We propose a novel, model-agnostic open-set
detection framework designed specifically for embedding-based detectors. The
method explicitly handles unknown object rejection while maintaining robustness
against corrupted flight data. It estimates semantic uncertainty via entropy
modeling in the embedding space and incorporates spectral normalization and
temperature scaling to enhance open-set discrimination. We validate our
approach on the challenging AOT aerial benchmark and through extensive
real-world flight tests. Comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate consistent
improvements over baseline methods, achieving up to a 10\% relative AUROC gain
compared to standard YOLO-based detectors. Additionally, we show that
background rejection further strengthens robustness without compromising
detection accuracy, making our solution particularly well-suited for reliable
UAV perception in dynamic air-to-air environments.

Abstract: Understanding 3D medical image volumes is critical in the medical field, yet
existing 3D medical convolution and transformer-based self-supervised learning
(SSL) methods often lack deep semantic comprehension. Recent advancements in
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) provide a promising approach to
enhance image understanding through text descriptions. To leverage these 2D
MLLMs for improved 3D medical image understanding, we propose Med3DInsight, a
novel pretraining framework that integrates 3D image encoders with 2D MLLMs via
a specially designed plane-slice-aware transformer module. Additionally, our
model employs a partial optimal transport based alignment, demonstrating
greater tolerance to noise introduced by potential noises in LLM-generated

medical representation learning without requiring human annotations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate our state-of-the-art performance on two downstream
tasks, i.e., segmentation and classification, across various public datasets
with CT and MRI modalities, outperforming current SSL methods. Med3DInsight can
be seamlessly integrated into existing 3D medical image understanding networks,
potentially enhancing their performance. Our source code, generated datasets,

Abstract: Road traffic accidents remain a significant global concern, with human error,
particularly distracted and impaired driving, among the leading causes. This
study introduces a novel driver behavior classification system that uses
external observation techniques to detect indicators of distraction and
impairment. The proposed framework employs advanced computer vision
methodologies, including real-time object tracking, lateral displacement
analysis, and lane position monitoring. The system identifies unsafe driving
behaviors such as excessive lateral movement and erratic trajectory patterns by
implementing the YOLO object detection model and custom lane estimation
algorithms. Unlike systems reliant on inter-vehicular communication, this
vision-based approach enables behavioral analysis of non-connected vehicles.
Experimental evaluations on diverse video datasets demonstrate the framework's
reliability and adaptability across varying road and environmental conditions.

Conclusion: 通过整合环境中固定物体信息和交互区域信息，多任务学习方法能够显著提升人与固定物体交互识别的性能

Abstract: Recent graph convolutional neural networks (GCNs) have shown high performance
in the field of human action recognition by using human skeleton poses.
However, it fails to detect human-object interaction cases successfully due to
the lack of effective representation of the scene information and appropriate
learning architectures. In this context, we propose a methodology to utilize
human action recognition performance by considering fixed object information in
the environment and following a multi-task learning approach. In order to
evaluate the proposed method, we collected real data from public environments
and prepared our data set, which includes interaction classes of hands-on fixed
objects (e.g., ATM ticketing machines, check-in/out machines, etc.) and
non-interaction classes of walking and standing. The multi-task learning
approach, along with interaction area information, succeeds in recognizing the
studied interaction and non-interaction actions with an accuracy of 99.25%,
outperforming the accuracy of the base model using only human skeleton poses by
2.75%.

Abstract: Event cameras capture changes in brightness with microsecond precision and
remain reliable under motion blur and challenging illumination, offering clear
advantages for modeling highly dynamic scenes. Yet, their integration with
natural language understanding has received little attention, leaving a gap in
multimodal perception. To address this, we introduce Talk2Event, the first
large-scale benchmark for language-driven object grounding using event data.
Built on real-world driving scenarios, Talk2Event comprises 5,567 scenes,
13,458 annotated objects, and more than 30,000 carefully validated referring
expressions. Each expression is enriched with four structured attributes --
appearance, status, relation to the viewer, and relation to surrounding objects
-- that explicitly capture spatial, temporal, and relational cues. This
attribute-centric design supports interpretable and compositional grounding,
enabling analysis that moves beyond simple object recognition to contextual
reasoning in dynamic environments. We envision Talk2Event as a foundation for
advancing multimodal and temporally-aware perception, with applications
spanning robotics, human-AI interaction, and so on.

Method: 提出IRDFusion框架，包含互相特征精炼模块(MFRM)和差分特征反馈模块(DFFM)。MFRM通过建模特征关系来提升模态内和模态间表征，DFFM动态计算模态间差分特征作为指导信号进行反馈

Conclusion: IRDFusion通过迭代关系地图差分导向的特征融合机制，能够逐步放大显著关系信号并压制特征噪声，实现了高质量的跨模态融合，证明了其健壮性和有效性

Abstract: Current multispectral object detection methods often retain extraneous
background or noise during feature fusion, limiting perceptual performance.To
address this, we propose an innovative feature fusion framework based on
cross-modal feature contrastive and screening strategy, diverging from
conventional approaches. The proposed method adaptively enhances salient
structures by fusing object-aware complementary cross-modal features while
suppressing shared background interference.Our solution centers on two novel,
specially designed modules: the Mutual Feature Refinement Module (MFRM) and the
Differential Feature Feedback Module (DFFM). The MFRM enhances intra- and
inter-modal feature representations by modeling their relationships, thereby
improving cross-modal alignment and discriminative power.Inspired by feedback
differential amplifiers, the DFFM dynamically computes inter-modal differential
features as guidance signals and feeds them back to the MFRM, enabling adaptive
fusion of complementary information while suppressing common-mode noise across
modalities. To enable robust feature learning, the MFRM and DFFM are integrated
into a unified framework, which is formally formulated as an Iterative
Relation-Map Differential Guided Feature Fusion mechanism, termed IRDFusion.
IRDFusion enables high-quality cross-modal fusion by progressively amplifying
salient relational signals through iterative feedback, while suppressing
feature noise, leading to significant performance gains.In extensive
experiments on FLIR, LLVIP and M$^3$FD datasets, IRDFusion achieves
state-of-the-art performance and consistently outperforms existing methods
across diverse challenging scenarios, demonstrating its robustness and
effectiveness. Code will be available at

Conclusion: SQAP-VLA是首个同时实现最先进量化和token剪枝的框架，成功解决了两者不兼容问题，为VLA模型的实际部署提供了高效解决方案

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models exhibit unprecedented capabilities for
embodied intelligence. However, their extensive computational and memory costs
hinder their practical deployment. Existing VLA compression and acceleration
approaches conduct quantization or token pruning in an ad-hoc manner but fail
to enable both for a holistic efficiency improvement due to an observed
incompatibility. This work introduces SQAP-VLA, the first structured,
training-free VLA inference acceleration framework that simultaneously enables
state-of-the-art quantization and token pruning. We overcome the
incompatibility by co-designing the quantization and token pruning pipeline,
where we propose new quantization-aware token pruning criteria that work on an
aggressively quantized model while improving the quantizer design to enhance
pruning effectiveness. When applied to standard VLA models, SQAP-VLA yields
significant gains in computational efficiency and inference speed while
successfully preserving core model performance, achieving a $\times$1.93
speedup and up to a 4.5\% average success rate enhancement compared to the
original model.

Abstract: LiDAR-based global localization is an essential component of simultaneous
localization and mapping (SLAM), which helps loop closure and re-localization.
Current approaches rely on ground-truth poses obtained from GPS or SLAM
odometry to supervise network training. Despite the great success of these
supervised approaches, substantial cost and effort are required for
high-precision ground-truth pose acquisition. In this work, we propose
S-BEVLoc, a novel self-supervised framework based on bird's-eye view (BEV) for
LiDAR global localization, which eliminates the need for ground-truth poses and
is highly scalable. We construct training triplets from single BEV images by
leveraging the known geographic distances between keypoint-centered BEV
patches. Convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to extract local features,
and NetVLAD is employed to aggregate global descriptors. Moreover, we introduce
SoftCos loss to enhance learning from the generated triplets. Experimental
results on the large-scale KITTI and NCLT datasets show that S-BEVLoc achieves
state-of-the-art performance in place recognition, loop closure, and global
localization tasks, while offering scalability that would require extra effort
for supervised approaches.

Abstract: Foundation segmentation models achieve reasonable leaf instance extraction
from top-view crop images without training (i.e., zero-shot). However,
segmenting entire plant individuals with each consisting of multiple
overlapping leaves remains challenging. This problem is referred to as a
hierarchical segmentation task, typically requiring annotated training
datasets, which are often species-specific and require notable human labor. To
address this, we introduce ZeroPlantSeg, a zero-shot segmentation for
rosette-shaped plant individuals from top-view images. We integrate a
foundation segmentation model, extracting leaf instances, and a vision-language
model, reasoning about plants' structures to extract plant individuals without
additional training. Evaluations on datasets with multiple plant species,
growth stages, and shooting environments demonstrate that our method surpasses
existing zero-shot methods and achieves better cross-domain performance than
supervised methods. Implementations are available at

Motivation: CLIP在行人表征学习中面临两个关键挑战：缺乏大规模标注的行人中心视觉-语言数据，以及全局对比学习难以保持细粒度匹配所需的判别性局部特征且对噪声文本标记敏感。

Method: 1) 开发基于MLLM上下文学习能力的噪声抵抗数据构建管道，自动过滤和标注网络图像，构建5M高质量WebPerson数据集；2) 提出GA-DMS框架，通过梯度注意力相似性评分自适应掩码噪声文本标记，并引入掩码标记预测目标增强细粒度语义表征学习。

Conclusion: 通过数据构建和模型架构的协同改进，成功提升了CLIP在行人表征学习中的性能，GA-DMS框架在多个基准测试中表现优异。

Abstract: Although Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) exhibits strong
performance across diverse vision tasks, its application to person
representation learning faces two critical challenges: (i) the scarcity of
large-scale annotated vision-language data focused on person-centric images,
and (ii) the inherent limitations of global contrastive learning, which
struggles to maintain discriminative local features crucial for fine-grained
matching while remaining vulnerable to noisy text tokens. This work advances
CLIP for person representation learning through synergistic improvements in
data curation and model architecture. First, we develop a noise-resistant data
construction pipeline that leverages the in-context learning capabilities of
MLLMs to automatically filter and caption web-sourced images. This yields
WebPerson, a large-scale dataset of 5M high-quality person-centric image-text
pairs. Second, we introduce the GA-DMS (Gradient-Attention Guided Dual-Masking
Synergetic) framework, which improves cross-modal alignment by adaptively
masking noisy textual tokens based on the gradient-attention similarity score.
Additionally, we incorporate masked token prediction objectives that compel the
model to predict informative text tokens, enhancing fine-grained semantic
representation learning. Extensive experiments show that GA-DMS achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.

TL;DR: ALL-PET是一个低资源、低样本的PET投影域基础模型，通过潜在扩散模型和三项创新技术，仅用500个样本就能实现高质量sinogram生成，并支持多种PET成像任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决PET成像中标注数据有限和计算资源不足的问题，克服数据稀缺和效率限制，构建大规模基础模型。

Method: 使用潜在扩散模型(LDM)，包含三项关键技术：1)Radon掩码增强策略(RMAS)生成20万+多样化训练样本；2)正负掩码约束确保几何一致性；3)透明医学注意力(TMA)机制增强病灶相关区域。

Result: 仅用500个样本就实现了高质量的sinogram生成，性能可与大数据集训练的模型相媲美，内存使用低于24GB，支持低剂量重建、衰减校正、延迟帧预测和示踪剂分离等多种任务。

Conclusion: ALL-PET成功解决了PET成像中的数据稀缺问题，提供了一个高效、灵活且可解释的基础模型框架，在低资源条件下实现了优异的性能表现。

Abstract: Building large-scale foundation model for PET imaging is hindered by limited
access to labeled data and insufficient computational resources. To overcome
data scarcity and efficiency limitations, we propose ALL-PET, a low-resource,
low-shot PET foundation model operating directly in the projection domain.
ALL-PET leverages a latent diffusion model (LDM) with three key innovations.
First, we design a Radon mask augmentation strategy (RMAS) that generates over
200,000 structurally diverse training samples by projecting randomized
image-domain masks into sinogram space, significantly improving generalization
with minimal data. This is extended by a dynamic multi-mask (DMM) mechanism
that varies mask quantity and distribution, enhancing data diversity without
added model complexity. Second, we implement positive/negative mask constraints
to embed strict geometric consistency, reducing parameter burden while
preserving generation quality. Third, we introduce transparent medical
attention (TMA), a parameter-free, geometry-driven mechanism that enhances
lesion-related regions in raw projection data. Lesion-focused attention maps
are derived from coarse segmentation, covering both hypermetabolic and
hypometabolic areas, and projected into sinogram space for physically
consistent guidance. The system supports clinician-defined ROI adjustments,
ensuring flexible, interpretable, and task-adaptive emphasis aligned with PET
acquisition physics. Experimental results show ALL-PET achieves high-quality
sinogram generation using only 500 samples, with performance comparable to
models trained on larger datasets. ALL-PET generalizes across tasks including
low-dose reconstruction, attenuation correction, delayed-frame prediction, and
tracer separation, operating efficiently with memory use under 24GB.

TL;DR: 比较神经网络与持久同调在噪声环境下预测Betti数的性能，发现神经网络在噪声鲁棒性方面优于传统拓扑分析方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究神经网络和持久同调这两种不同方法在从数据推断拓扑结构时的噪声鲁棒性，探索神经网络作为拓扑分析替代方案的潜力

Method: 使用监督神经网络预测2D二值图像的Betti数，并与基于立方复形和符号欧几里得距离变换(SEDT)的持久同调方法进行对比，在一个合成数据集和两个真实数据集上进行实验

Result: 神经网络在噪声条件下表现优于持久同调方法，这归因于神经网络能够从训练数据中学习上下文和几何先验知识

Conclusion: 尽管仍处于发展阶段，但神经网络在结构噪声下的拓扑估计为持久同调提供了一个有吸引力的替代方案

Abstract: Persistent Homology (PH) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) offer
contrasting approaches to inferring topological structure from data. In this
study, we examine the noise robustness of a supervised neural network trained
to predict Betti numbers in 2D binary images. We compare an ANN approach
against a PH pipeline based on cubical complexes and the Signed Euclidean
Distance Transform (SEDT), which is a widely adopted strategy for noise-robust
topological analysis. Using one synthetic and two real-world datasets, we show
that ANNs can outperform this PH approach under noise, likely due to their
capacity to learn contextual and geometric priors from training data. Though
still emerging, the use of ANNs for topology estimation offers a compelling
alternative to PH under structural noise.

TL;DR: OSIM是一个新的3D场景评估指标，专注于对象级别的感知评估，比现有指标更符合人类视觉感知


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有指标主要评估整体图像质量，与人类感知存在差异。基于神经心理学研究，人类对3D场景的识别主要关注单个对象

Method: 利用对象检测模型及其特征表示来量化场景中每个对象的"对象性"，进行以对象为中心的评估

Result: 用户研究表明OSIM比现有指标更接近人类感知，并通过多种方法分析了OSIM的特性

Conclusion: OSIM提供了一个更符合人类感知的3D场景评估标准，有助于澄清3D重建和生成模型的发展进展

Abstract: This paper presents Objectness SIMilarity (OSIM), a novel evaluation metric
for 3D scenes that explicitly focuses on "objects," which are fundamental units
of human visual perception. Existing metrics assess overall image quality,
leading to discrepancies with human perception. Inspired by neuropsychological
insights, we hypothesize that human recognition of 3D scenes fundamentally
involves attention to individual objects. OSIM enables object-centric
evaluations by leveraging an object detection model and its feature
representations to quantify the "objectness" of each object in the scene. Our
user study demonstrates that OSIM aligns more closely with human perception
compared to existing metrics. We also analyze the characteristics of OSIM using
various approaches. Moreover, we re-evaluate recent 3D reconstruction and
generation models under a standardized experimental setup to clarify
advancements in this field. The code is available at

Motivation: 现有调查主要按任务或模型家族分类，忽视了数据集通过运动复杂性、时间跨度、层次结构和多模态丰富性等结构性压力对架构演化的指导作用。

Method: 采用数据集驱动视角，重新解读从双流网络、3D CNN到序列模型、Transformer和多模态基础模型的里程碑进展，分析这些模型如何响应数据集驱动的压力。

Result: 建立了将数据集、归纳偏置和架构统一到连贯框架中的综合分析，展示了模型设计如何与数据集不变性对齐，同时平衡可扩展性和任务需求。

Conclusion: 该调查不仅提供了全面的回顾，还为推进通用视频理解提供了规范性路线图，强调了数据集驱动视角在指导未来模型设计中的重要性。

Abstract: Video understanding has advanced rapidly, fueled by increasingly complex
datasets and powerful architectures. Yet existing surveys largely classify
models by task or family, overlooking the structural pressures through which
datasets guide architectural evolution. This survey is the first to adopt a
dataset-driven perspective, showing how motion complexity, temporal span,
hierarchical composition, and multimodal richness impose inductive biases that
models should encode. We reinterpret milestones, from two-stream and 3D CNNs to
sequential, transformer, and multimodal foundation models, as concrete
responses to these dataset-driven pressures. Building on this synthesis, we
offer practical guidance for aligning model design with dataset invariances
while balancing scalability and task demands. By unifying datasets, inductive
biases, and architectures into a coherent framework, this survey provides both
a comprehensive retrospective and a prescriptive roadmap for advancing
general-purpose video understanding.

Motivation: 现有细胞检测模型难以模拟病理学家在不同放大倍数下观察全切片图像的行为，缺乏多尺度重叠细胞和组织标注数据集阻碍了细胞-组织相互作用语义的学习。

Method: 收集来自306个TCGA全切片图像的673对标注数据，包含六个器官的重叠细胞检测和组织分割标注，分为训练、验证和测试集，鼓励参与者开发理解细胞-组织关系的模型。

Result: 参与者提出的模型显著增强了对细胞-组织关系的理解，最佳模型在测试集上相比不包含细胞-组织关系的基线细胞检测模型F1分数提升了7.99。

Conclusion: 多尺度语义的融入对模型性能有实质性改善，证明了理解细胞-组织相互作用对于达到人类水平性能的重要性，为相关研究领域提供了重要推动。

Abstract: Pathologists routinely alternate between different magnifications when
examining Whole-Slide Images, allowing them to evaluate both broad tissue
morphology and intricate cellular details to form comprehensive diagnoses.
However, existing deep learning-based cell detection models struggle to
replicate these behaviors and learn the interdependent semantics between
structures at different magnifications. A key barrier in the field is the lack
of datasets with multi-scale overlapping cell and tissue annotations. The
OCELOT 2023 challenge was initiated to gather insights from the community to
validate the hypothesis that understanding cell and tissue (cell-tissue)
interactions is crucial for achieving human-level performance, and to
accelerate the research in this field. The challenge dataset includes
overlapping cell detection and tissue segmentation annotations from six organs,
comprising 673 pairs sourced from 306 The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
Whole-Slide Images with hematoxylin and eosin staining, divided into training,
validation, and test subsets. Participants presented models that significantly
enhanced the understanding of cell-tissue relationships. Top entries achieved
up to a 7.99 increase in F1-score on the test set compared to the baseline
cell-only model that did not incorporate cell-tissue relationships. This is a
substantial improvement in performance over traditional cell-only detection
methods, demonstrating the need for incorporating multi-scale semantics into
the models. This paper provides a comparative analysis of the methods used by
participants, highlighting innovative strategies implemented in the OCELOT 2023
challenge.

Conclusion: 本研究为实时检测系统中的特征编码设计提供了有效方法，特别适用于无人机图像目标检测场景。

Abstract: Object detection in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery presents
significant challenges. Issues such as densely packed small objects, scale
variations, and occlusion are commonplace. This paper introduces RT-DETR++,
which enhances the encoder component of the RT-DETR model. Our improvements
focus on two key aspects. First, we introduce a channel-gated attention-based
upsampling/downsampling (AU/AD) mechanism. This dual-path system minimizes
errors and preserves details during feature layer propagation. Second, we
incorporate CSP-PAC during feature fusion. This technique employs parallel
hollow convolutions to process local and contextual information within the same
layer, facilitating the integration of multi-scale features. Evaluation
demonstrates that our novel neck design achieves superior performance in
detecting small and densely packed objects. The model maintains sufficient
speed for real-time detection without increasing computational complexity. This
study provides an effective approach for feature encoding design in real-time
detection systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法直接使用检索到的知识导致知识冗余和噪声，影响回答准确性

Method: 1、优化检索查询减少噪声 2、使用大模型识别和提取有用知识段落 3、仅在模型信心不足时集成知识

Result: 广泛实验证明该框架超越了最先进方法

Conclusion: 该无需训练的框架能够获得准确关键知识，有效减少知识冗余带来的噪声影响

Abstract: Knowledge-based visual question answering (KB-VQA) requires a model to
understand images and utilize external knowledge to provide accurate answers.
Existing approaches often directly augment models with retrieved information
from knowledge sources while ignoring substantial knowledge redundancy, which
introduces noise into the answering process. To address this, we propose a
training-free framework with knowledge focusing for KB-VQA, that mitigates the
impact of noise by enhancing knowledge relevance and reducing redundancy.
First, for knowledge retrieval, our framework concludes essential parts from
the image-question pairs, creating low-noise queries that enhance the retrieval
of highly relevant knowledge. Considering that redundancy still persists in the
retrieved knowledge, we then prompt large models to identify and extract
answer-beneficial segments from knowledge. In addition, we introduce a
selective knowledge integration strategy, allowing the model to incorporate
knowledge only when it lacks confidence in answering the question, thereby
mitigating the influence of redundant information. Our framework enables the
acquisition of accurate and critical knowledge, and extensive experiments
demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 本研究提出CWSSNet分类框架，融合3D光谱空间特征和小波卷积，有效解决高光谱图像特征冗余问题，在江西余干县地物分类中取得优异性能，mIoU达74.50%，且在小样本训练条件下表现稳健。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱遥感技术在林业生态和精准农业等领域有重要应用价值，但高光谱图像波段多、维度高、光谱混合等特点导致特征冗余问题突出，需要更精细的地物分类方法。

Method: 使用ZY1F卫星高光谱图像数据，提出CWSSNet分类框架，整合3D光谱空间特征和小波卷积，采用多尺度卷积注意力模块融合多模态信息，通过小波域多波段分解和卷积操作突破传统方法性能瓶颈。

Result: 在余干县实验中，CWSSNet在mIoU、mAcc和mF1上分别达到74.50%、82.73%和84.94%，在水体、植被和裸地分类中IoU最高，训练集比例为70%时训练时间增加有限且分类效果接近最优，小样本训练条件下性能可靠。

Conclusion: CWSSNet框架有效解决了高光谱图像特征冗余问题，提升了地物分类精度，在小样本条件下仍保持良好性能，为高光谱遥感地物分类提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Hyperspectral remote sensing technology has significant application value in
fields such as forestry ecology and precision agriculture, while also putting
forward higher requirements for fine ground object classification. However,
although hyperspectral images are rich in spectral information and can improve
recognition accuracy, they tend to cause prominent feature redundancy due to
their numerous bands, high dimensionality, and spectral mixing characteristics.
To address this, this study used hyperspectral images from the ZY1F satellite
as a data source and selected Yugan County, Shangrao City, Jiangxi Province as
the research area to perform ground object classification research. A
classification framework named CWSSNet was proposed, which integrates 3D
spectral-spatial features and wavelet convolution. This framework integrates
multimodal information us-ing a multiscale convolutional attention module and
breaks through the classification performance bottleneck of traditional methods
by introducing multi-band decomposition and convolution operations in the
wavelet domain. The experiments showed that CWSSNet achieved 74.50\%, 82.73\%,
and 84.94\% in mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), mean Accuracy (mAcc), and
mean F1-score (mF1) respectively in Yugan County. It also obtained the highest
Intersection over Union (IoU) in the classifica-tion of water bodies,
vegetation, and bare land, demonstrating good robustness. Additionally, when
the training set proportion was 70\%, the increase in training time was
limited, and the classification effect was close to the optimal level,
indicating that the model maintains reliable performance under small-sample
training conditions.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of generative models, highly realistic image

Although AI-generated image detection methods have partially addressed these
concerns, a substantial research gap remains in evaluating their performance
under complex real-world conditions. This paper introduces the Real-World
Robustness Dataset (RRDataset) for comprehensive evaluation of detection models
across three dimensions: 1) Scenario Generalization: RRDataset encompasses
high-quality images from seven major scenarios (War and Conflict, Disasters and
Accidents, Political and Social Events, Medical and Public Health, Culture and
Religion, Labor and Production, and everyday life), addressing existing dataset
gaps from a content perspective. 2) Internet Transmission Robustness: examining
detector performance on images that have undergone multiple rounds of sharing
across various social media platforms. 3) Re-digitization Robustness: assessing
model effectiveness on images altered through four distinct re-digitization
methods. We benchmarked 17 detectors and 10 vision-language models (VLMs) on
RRDataset and conducted a large-scale human study involving 192 participants to

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种轻量级自适应Dark-ISP插件，直接处理黑暗环境下的Bayer RAW图像，通过解构传统ISP流程为可微分模块，并使用任务驱动损失进行优化，在低光物体检测任务中较现有方法更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低光物体检测在实际应用中很重要，但因图像质量下降而面临挑战。虽然RAW图像比RGB图像有更好潜力，但现有方法或者有信息损失，或者框架复杂。需要一种轻量级且能够直接处理RAW图像的方案。

Method: 将传统ISP流程解构为序列线性模块（传感器校准）和非线性模块（调色映射），重构为可微分组件通过任务驱动损失优化。每个模块具备内容感知适应性和物理信息先验知识。利用ISP流程的内在级联结构，设计了自我提升机制促进子模块合作。

Result: 在三个RAW图像数据集上进行了涉广实验，证明该方法在具有挑战性的低光环境中，以最少的参数量超越了现有的RGB和RAW基于检测的方法，达到了更优的结果。

Conclusion: Dark-ISP提供了一种轻量级且自适应的方案，能够直接处理黑暗环境下的Bayer RAW图像，实现了无绑定的端到端训练，为低光物体检测提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Low-light Object detection is crucial for many real-world applications but
remains challenging due to degraded image quality. While recent studies have
shown that RAW images offer superior potential over RGB images, existing
approaches either use RAW-RGB images with information loss or employ complex
frameworks. To address these, we propose a lightweight and self-adaptive Image
Signal Processing (ISP) plugin, Dark-ISP, which directly processes Bayer RAW
images in dark environments, enabling seamless end-to-end training for object
detection. Our key innovations are: (1) We deconstruct conventional ISP
pipelines into sequential linear (sensor calibration) and nonlinear (tone
mapping) sub-modules, recasting them as differentiable components optimized
through task-driven losses. Each module is equipped with content-aware
adaptability and physics-informed priors, enabling automatic RAW-to-RGB
conversion aligned with detection objectives. (2) By exploiting the ISP
pipeline's intrinsic cascade structure, we devise a Self-Boost mechanism that
facilitates cooperation between sub-modules. Through extensive experiments on
three RAW image datasets, we demonstrate that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art RGB- and RAW-based detection approaches, achieving superior
results with minimal parameters in challenging low-light environments.

Conclusion: 多粒度建模能有效提升目标引导轨迹预测性能，递归精炼和跨粒度特征整合是成功的关键因素。

Abstract: Accurate human trajectory prediction is crucial for robotics navigation and
autonomous driving. Recent research has demonstrated that incorporating goal
guidance significantly enhances prediction accuracy by reducing uncertainty and
leveraging prior knowledge. Most goal-guided approaches decouple the prediction
task into two stages: goal prediction and subsequent trajectory completion
based on the predicted goal, which operate at extreme granularities:
coarse-grained goal prediction forecasts the overall intention, while
fine-grained trajectory completion needs to generate the positions for all
future timesteps. The potential utility of intermediate temporal granularity
remains largely unexplored, which motivates multi-granularity trajectory
modeling. While prior work has shown that multi-granularity representations
capture diverse scales of human dynamics and motion patterns, effectively
integrating this concept into goal-guided frameworks remains challenging. In
this paper, we propose MGTraj, a novel Multi-Granularity goal-guided model for
human Trajectory prediction. MGTraj recursively encodes trajectory proposals
from coarse to fine granularity levels. At each level, a transformer-based
recursive refinement network (RRN) captures features and predicts progressive
refinements. Features across different granularities are integrated using a
weight-sharing strategy, and velocity prediction is employed as an auxiliary
task to further enhance performance. Comprehensive experimental results in
EHT/UCY and Stanford Drone Dataset indicate that MGTraj outperforms baseline
methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance among goal-guided methods.

Conclusion: Medverse展示了上下文学习在医学影像分析中的巨大潜力，为通用医学影像处理提供了有效的解决方案，代码和模型权重已公开。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) offers a promising paradigm for universal medical
image analysis, enabling models to perform diverse image processing tasks
without retraining. However, current ICL models for medical imaging remain
limited in two critical aspects: they cannot simultaneously achieve
high-fidelity predictions and global anatomical understanding, and there is no
unified model trained across diverse medical imaging tasks (e.g., segmentation
and enhancement) and anatomical regions. As a result, the full potential of ICL
in medical imaging remains underexplored. Thus, we present \textbf{Medverse}, a
universal ICL model for 3D medical imaging, trained on 22 datasets covering
diverse tasks in universal image segmentation, transformation, and enhancement
across multiple organs, imaging modalities, and clinical centers. Medverse
employs a next-scale autoregressive in-context learning framework that
progressively refines predictions from coarse to fine, generating consistent,
full-resolution volumetric outputs and enabling multi-scale anatomical
awareness. We further propose a blockwise cross-attention module that
facilitates long-range interactions between context and target inputs while
preserving computational efficiency through spatial sparsity. Medverse is
extensively evaluated on a broad collection of held-out datasets covering
previously unseen clinical centers, organs, species, and imaging modalities.
Results demonstrate that Medverse substantially outperforms existing ICL
baselines and establishes a novel paradigm for in-context learning. Code and
model weights will be made publicly available. Our model are publicly available
at https://github.com/jiesihu/Medverse.

Abstract: Background and objective Early diagnosis of gastric diseases is crucial to
prevent fatal outcomes. Although histopathologic examination remains the
diagnostic gold standard, it is performed entirely manually, making evaluations
labor-intensive and prone to variability among pathologists. Critical findings
may be missed, and lack of standard procedures reduces consistency. These
limitations highlight the need for automated, reliable, and efficient methods
for gastric tissue analysis. Methods In this study, a novel hybrid model named
CoAtNeXt was proposed for the classification of gastric tissue images. The
model is built upon the CoAtNet architecture by replacing its MBConv layers
with enhanced ConvNeXtV2 blocks. Additionally, the Convolutional Block
Attention Module (CBAM) is integrated to improve local feature extraction
through channel and spatial attention mechanisms. The architecture was scaled
to achieve a balance between computational efficiency and classification
performance. CoAtNeXt was evaluated on two publicly available datasets,
HMU-GC-HE-30K for eight-class classification and GasHisSDB for binary
classification, and was compared against 10 Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) and ten Vision Transformer (ViT) models. Results CoAtNeXt achieved
96.47% accuracy, 96.60% precision, 96.47% recall, 96.45% F1 score, and 99.89%
AUC on HMU-GC-HE-30K. On GasHisSDB, it reached 98.29% accuracy, 98.07%
precision, 98.41% recall, 98.23% F1 score, and 99.90% AUC. It outperformed all
CNN and ViT models tested and surpassed previous studies in the literature.
Conclusion Experimental results show that CoAtNeXt is a robust architecture for
histopathological classification of gastric tissue images, providing
performance on binary and multiclass. Its highlights its potential to assist
pathologists by enhancing diagnostic accuracy and reducing workload.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型视觉语言模型在牙科等专业医疗领域的有效性尚未充分探索，特别是全景X射线影像由于密集解剖结构和细微病理线索带来的解释挑战，缺乏专门的基准数据集

Method: 构建包含20,563张标注图像和130万指令实例的MMOral数据集，涵盖属性提取、报告生成、视觉问答和图像对话等任务类型；基于Qwen2.5-VL-7B进行监督微调开发OralGPT模型

Result: 评估64个LVLM模型发现最佳模型GPT-4o仅达到41.45%准确率；OralGPT经过单轮SFT后性能提升24.73%，显著优于现有模型

Conclusion: MMOral数据集和OralGPT模型为智能牙科发展提供了重要基础，有望推动牙科领域多模态AI系统的临床应用

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated
strong performance on general-purpose medical tasks. However, their
effectiveness in specialized domains such as dentistry remains underexplored.
In particular, panoramic X-rays, a widely used imaging modality in oral
radiology, pose interpretative challenges due to dense anatomical structures
and subtle pathological cues, which are not captured by existing medical
benchmarks or instruction datasets. To this end, we introduce MMOral, the first
large-scale multimodal instruction dataset and benchmark tailored for panoramic
X-ray interpretation. MMOral consists of 20,563 annotated images paired with
1.3 million instruction-following instances across diverse task types,
including attribute extraction, report generation, visual question answering,
and image-grounded dialogue. In addition, we present MMOral-Bench, a
comprehensive evaluation suite covering five key diagnostic dimensions in
dentistry. We evaluate 64 LVLMs on MMOral-Bench and find that even the
best-performing model, i.e., GPT-4o, only achieves 41.45% accuracy, revealing
significant limitations of current models in this domain. To promote the
progress of this specific domain, we also propose OralGPT, which conducts
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) upon Qwen2.5-VL-7B with our meticulously curated
MMOral instruction dataset. Remarkably, a single epoch of SFT yields
substantial performance enhancements for LVLMs, e.g., OralGPT demonstrates a
24.73% improvement. Both MMOral and OralGPT hold significant potential as a
critical foundation for intelligent dentistry and enable more clinically
impactful multimodal AI systems in the dental field. The dataset, model,
benchmark, and evaluation suite are available at

TL;DR: 提出了DATE方法，通过时间戳注入和语义引导的时间感知采样策略，显著提升多模态大语言模型在长视频理解中的时间推理能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法采用均匀帧采样和隐式位置编码，难以处理长视频中的长距离依赖关系，导致关键信息丢失和时间理解能力下降

Method: DATE方法包含时间戳注入机制(TIM)和时间感知相似性采样策略(TASS)：1)将视频帧嵌入与文本时间戳令牌交错构建连续时间参考系统；2)将视频采样重新定义为视觉-语言检索任务，采用两阶段算法确保语义相关性和时间覆盖

Result: 在7B和72B模型上实现了小时级长视频基准测试的最先进性能，7B模型在某些基准上甚至超过了许多72B模型

Conclusion: DATE方法通过显式时间建模和语义引导采样，有效解决了长视频理解中的时间推理挑战，为多模态大模型的长视频处理提供了新思路

Abstract: Long video understanding remains a fundamental challenge for multimodal large
language models (MLLMs), particularly in tasks requiring precise temporal
reasoning and event localization. Existing approaches typically adopt uniform
frame sampling and rely on implicit position encodings to model temporal order.
However, these methods struggle with long-range dependencies, leading to
critical information loss and degraded temporal comprehension. In this paper,
we propose Dynamic Absolute Time Enhancement (DATE) that enhances temporal
awareness in MLLMs through the Timestamp Injection Mechanism (TIM) and a
semantically guided Temporal-Aware Similarity Sampling (TASS) strategy.
Specifically, we interleave video frame embeddings with textual timestamp
tokens to construct a continuous temporal reference system. We further
reformulate the video sampling problem as a vision-language retrieval task and
introduce a two-stage algorithm to ensure both semantic relevance and temporal
coverage: enriching each query into a descriptive caption to better align with
the vision feature, and sampling key event with a similarity-driven temporally
regularized greedy strategy. Our method achieves remarkable improvements w.r.t.
absolute time understanding and key event localization, resulting in
state-of-the-art performance among 7B and 72B models on hour-long video
benchmarks. Particularly, our 7B model even exceeds many 72B models on some
benchmarks.

Motivation: 解决3D医学图像分割资源消耗大、现有高效模型静态设计缺乏适应性、难以平衡性能与效率的问题。

Method: 从冗余模型开始，通过块级剪枝和功能解耦损失迭代剪枝冗余模块，实现动态高效的3D分割。

Result: 轻量版PSP-Seg-S在五个数据集上与nnU-Net性能相当，GPU内存减少42-45%，训练时间减少29-48%，参数量减少83-87%。

Conclusion: PSP-Seg具有作为成本效益高且高性能的临床应用的潜力。

Abstract: 3D medical image segmentation often faces heavy resource and time
consumption, limiting its scalability and rapid deployment in clinical
environments. Existing efficient segmentation models are typically static and
manually designed prior to training, which restricts their adaptability across
diverse tasks and makes it difficult to balance performance with resource
efficiency. In this paper, we propose PSP-Seg, a progressive pruning framework
that enables dynamic and efficient 3D segmentation. PSP-Seg begins with a
redundant model and iteratively prunes redundant modules through a combination
of block-wise pruning and a functional decoupling loss. We evaluate PSP-Seg on
five public datasets, benchmarking it against seven state-of-the-art models and
six efficient segmentation models. Results demonstrate that the lightweight
variant, PSP-Seg-S, achieves performance on par with nnU-Net while reducing GPU
memory usage by 42-45%, training time by 29-48%, and parameter number by 83-87%
across all datasets. These findings underscore PSP-Seg's potential as a
cost-effective yet high-performing alternative for widespread clinical
application.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图表理解方法存在局限性：依赖外部工具导致脆弱性，或使用单一推理策略（如文本链式思维）难以验证中间步骤。需要一种可验证且自适应的推理方法。

Method: 提出CaT方法，将图表信息转换为可验证的符号格式。引入视觉可编程性概念，让VLM学习选择代码推理路径或直接视觉推理路径。使用双奖励系统的强化学习训练选择策略。

Result: 在多样化图表理解基准测试中展现出强大且稳健的性能，证明了VLM不仅能学习推理，还能学习如何推理。

Conclusion: VLMs可以通过自适应选择最优推理路径来提升图表理解能力，CaT方法为解决复杂视觉推理任务提供了有效框架。

Abstract: Chart understanding presents a critical test to the reasoning capabilities of
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Prior approaches face critical limitations: some
rely on external tools, making them brittle and constrained by a predefined
toolkit, while others fine-tune specialist models that often adopt a single
reasoning strategy, such as text-based chain-of-thought (CoT). The intermediate
steps of text-based reasoning are difficult to verify, which complicates the
use of reinforcement-learning signals that reward factual accuracy. To address
this, we propose a Code-as-Thought (CaT) approach to represent the visual
information of a chart in a verifiable, symbolic format. Our key insight is
that this strategy must be adaptive: a fixed, code-only implementation
consistently fails on complex charts where symbolic representation is
unsuitable. This finding leads us to introduce Visual Programmability: a
learnable property that determines if a chart-question pair is better solved
with code or direct visual analysis. We implement this concept in an adaptive
framework where a VLM learns to choose between the CaT pathway and a direct
visual reasoning pathway. The selection policy of the model is trained with
reinforcement learning using a novel dual-reward system. This system combines a
data-accuracy reward to ground the model in facts and prevent numerical
hallucination, with a decision reward that teaches the model when to use each
strategy, preventing it from defaulting to a single reasoning mode. Experiments
demonstrate strong and robust performance across diverse chart-understanding
benchmarks. Our work shows that VLMs can be taught not only to reason but also
how to reason, dynamically selecting the optimal reasoning pathway for each
task.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种模态无关的U-net架构改进，通过添加模态无关输入通道和图像增强方案，使模型能够处理训练时未见过的MRI模态，同时保持对已见模态的分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态脑MRI分割模型通常局限于固定模态，无法有效处理推理时的新模态。有些模型虽然能泛化到未见模态，但可能丢失模态特定的判别信息。

Method: 在U-net架构中集成模态无关输入通道和模态特定输入通道，开发图像增强方案合成人工MRI模态，通过差异性地改变病理和健康组织外观来创建人工对比度。

Result: 在包含5种病理类型和8种MRI模态的8个数据库上评估，结果显示该方法能有效处理训练时见过的MRI模态，同时能处理新的未见模态来改进分割。

Conclusion: 通过简单的架构改进和图像增强，可以开发出能够处理任意可用成像模态的分割模型，在保持已见模态性能的同时提升对未见模态的处理能力。

Abstract: Segmentation models are important tools for the detection and analysis of
lesions in brain MRI. Depending on the type of brain pathology that is imaged,
MRI scanners can acquire multiple, different image modalities (contrasts). Most
segmentation models for multimodal brain MRI are restricted to fixed modalities
and cannot effectively process new ones at inference. Some models generalize to
unseen modalities but may lose discriminative modality-specific information.
This work aims to develop a model that can perform inference on data that
contain image modalities unseen during training, previously seen modalities,
and heterogeneous combinations of both, thus allowing a user to utilize any
available imaging modalities. We demonstrate this is possible with a simple,
thus practical alteration to the U-net architecture, by integrating a
modality-agnostic input channel or pathway, alongside modality-specific input
channels. To train this modality-agnostic component, we develop an image
augmentation scheme that synthesizes artificial MRI modalities. Augmentations
differentially alter the appearance of pathological and healthy brain tissue to
create artificial contrasts between them while maintaining realistic anatomical
integrity. We evaluate the method using 8 MRI databases that include 5 types of
pathologies (stroke, tumours, traumatic brain injury, multiple sclerosis and
white matter hyperintensities) and 8 modalities (T1, T1+contrast, T2, PD, SWI,
DWI, ADC and FLAIR). The results demonstrate that the approach preserves the
ability to effectively process MRI modalities encountered during training,
while being able to process new, unseen modalities to improve its segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SlotSAR是一个针对SAR图像的目标中心学习框架，无需掩码标注即可将目标表征与背景杂波分离，通过结合高层语义特征和低层散射特征实现鲁棒的目标表征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAR图像中的复杂背景杂波（包括地形反射和斑点噪声）经常与目标具有相似的强度和模式，导致模型提取纠缠或虚假特征，影响目标表征的清晰度。

Method: 提出SlotSAR框架：1）从SARATR-X提取高层语义特征；2）从小波散射网络提取低层散射特征；3）设计多级槽注意力模块集成这些特征，增强槽级表征的区分性。

Result: 实验结果表明，SlotSAR在SAR图像处理中达到了最先进的性能，相比现有OCL方法更好地保留了结构细节。

Conclusion: SlotSAR通过多级特征集成和槽注意力机制，有效解决了SAR图像中目标与背景杂波的分离问题，无需掩码标注即可实现清晰的目标表征。

Abstract: Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images contain not only targets of interest
but also complex background clutter, including terrain reflections and speckle
noise. In many cases, such clutter exhibits intensity and patterns that
resemble targets, leading models to extract entangled or spurious features.
Such behavior undermines the ability to form clear target representations,
regardless of the classifier. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
object-centric learning (OCL) framework, named SlotSAR, that disentangles
target representations from background clutter in SAR images without mask
annotations. SlotSAR first extracts high-level semantic features from SARATR-X
and low-level scattering features from the wavelet scattering network in order
to obtain complementary multi-level representations for robust target
characterization. We further present a multi-level slot attention module that
integrates these low- and high-level features to enhance slot-wise
representation distinctiveness, enabling effective OCL. Experimental results
demonstrate that SlotSAR achieves state-of-the-art performance in SAR imagery
by preserving structural details compared to existing OCL methods.

Abstract: Materials characterization is fundamental to acquiring materials information,
revealing the processing-microstructure-property relationships that guide
material design and optimization. While multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) have recently shown promise in generative and predictive tasks within
materials science, their capacity to understand real-world characterization
imaging data remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we present MatCha, the
first benchmark for materials characterization image understanding, comprising
1,500 questions that demand expert-level domain expertise. MatCha encompasses
four key stages of materials research comprising 21 distinct tasks, each
designed to reflect authentic challenges faced by materials scientists. Our
evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs on MatCha reveals a significant
performance gap compared to human experts. These models exhibit degradation
when addressing questions requiring higher-level expertise and sophisticated
visual perception. Simple few-shot and chain-of-thought prompting struggle to
alleviate these limitations. These findings highlight that existing MLLMs still
exhibit limited adaptability to real-world materials characterization
scenarios. We hope MatCha will facilitate future research in areas such as new
material discovery and autonomous scientific agents. MatCha is available at

Result: 在OPV2V数据集上广泛实验表明，PHCP在各种异构场景下表现强劲，仅用少量无标签数据就达到与全数据集训练SOTA方法相当的性能

Conclusion: PHCP框架成功解决了异构协作感知的挑战，提供了一种实用的推理时解决方案，无需预先训练或存储多个模型

Abstract: Collaborative perception enables vehicles to overcome individual perception
limitations by sharing information, allowing them to see further and through
occlusions. In real-world scenarios, models on different vehicles are often
heterogeneous due to manufacturer variations. Existing methods for
heterogeneous collaborative perception address this challenge by fine-tuning
adapters or the entire network to bridge the domain gap. However, these methods
are impractical in real-world applications, as each new collaborator must
undergo joint training with the ego vehicle on a dataset before inference, or
the ego vehicle stores models for all potential collaborators in advance.
Therefore, we pose a new question: Can we tackle this challenge directly during
inference, eliminating the need for joint training? To answer this, we
introduce Progressive Heterogeneous Collaborative Perception (PHCP), a novel
framework that formulates the problem as few-shot unsupervised domain
adaptation. Unlike previous work, PHCP dynamically aligns features by
self-training an adapter during inference, eliminating the need for labeled
data and joint training. Extensive experiments on the OPV2V dataset demonstrate
that PHCP achieves strong performance across diverse heterogeneous scenarios.
Notably, PHCP achieves performance comparable to SOTA methods trained on the
entire dataset while using only a small amount of unlabeled data.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled strong zero-shot classification
through image-text alignment. Yet, their purely visual inference capabilities
remain under-explored. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of
both language-guided and vision-only image classification with a diverse set of
dual-encoder VLMs, including both well-established and recent models such as
SigLIP 2 and RADIOv2.5. The performance is compared in a standard setup on the
ImageNet-1k validation set and its label-corrected variant. The key factors
affecting accuracy are analysed, including prompt design, class diversity, the
number of neighbours in k-NN, and reference set size. We show that language and
vision offer complementary strengths, with some classes favouring textual
prompts and others better handled by visual similarity. To exploit this
complementarity, we introduce a simple, learning-free fusion method based on
per-class precision that improves classification performance. The code is

Conclusion: 领域相关的预训练数据比大规模但不相关的数据更有效，适当整合手术特定数据能显著提升少样本SSA性能，但领域不匹配的大规模数据反而可能导致性能下降

Abstract: Automated surgical skill assessment (SSA) is a central task in surgical
computer vision. Developing robust SSA models is challenging due to the
scarcity of skill annotations, which are time-consuming to produce and require
expert consensus. Few-shot learning (FSL) offers a scalable alternative
enabling model development with minimal supervision, though its success
critically depends on effective pre-training. While widely studied for several
surgical downstream tasks, pre-training has remained largely unexplored in SSA.
In this work, we formulate SSA as a few-shot task and investigate how
self-supervised pre-training strategies affect downstream few-shot SSA
performance. We annotate a publicly available robotic surgery dataset with
Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skill (OSATS) scores, and evaluate
various pre-training sources across three few-shot settings. We quantify domain
similarity and analyze how domain gap and the inclusion of procedure-specific
data into pre-training influence transferability. Our results show that small
but domain-relevant datasets can outperform large scale, less aligned ones,
achieving accuracies of 60.16%, 66.03%, and 73.65% in the 1-, 2-, and 5-shot
settings, respectively. Moreover, incorporating procedure-specific data into
pre-training with a domain-relevant external dataset significantly boosts
downstream performance, with an average gain of +1.22% in accuracy and +2.28%
in F1-score; however, applying the same strategy with less similar but
large-scale sources can instead lead to performance degradation. Code and
models are available at https://github.com/anastadimi/ssa-fsl.

Abstract: This paper aims to recover the intrinsic reflectance layer and shading layer
given a single image. Though this intrinsic image decomposition problem has
been studied for decades, it remains a significant challenge in cases of
complex scenes, i.e. spatially-varying lighting effect and rich textures. In
this paper, we propose a novel method for handling severe lighting and rich
textures in intrinsic image decomposition, which enables to produce
high-quality intrinsic images for real-world images. Specifically, we observe
that previous learning-based methods tend to produce texture-less and
over-smoothing intrinsic images, which can be used to infer the lighting and
texture information given a RGB image. In this way, we design a texture-guided
regularization term and formulate the decomposition problem into an
optimization framework, to separate the material textures and lighting effect.
We demonstrate that combining the novel texture-aware prior can produce
superior results to existing approaches.

Motivation: 研究PnP方法与扩散模型在逆问题解决中的联系，特别是在单像素成像任务中，以提高重建质量

Method: 将扩散过程解耦为三个可解释阶段：去噪、数据一致性维护和采样，并提出混合数据一致性模块，线性组合多个PnP风格的保真项

Result: 在单像素成像任务中实验结果显示，方法实现了更好的重建质量

Conclusion: 通过解耦扩散过程和混合数据一致性模块，成功将学习到的先验知识与物理前向模型集成在一个有理论基础的统一框架中

Abstract: We explore the connection between Plug-and-Play (PnP) methods and Denoising
Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) for solving ill-posed inverse problems, with a
focus on single-pixel imaging. We begin by identifying key distinctions between
PnP and diffusion models-particularly in their denoising mechanisms and
sampling procedures. By decoupling the diffusion process into three
interpretable stages: denoising, data consistency enforcement, and sampling, we
provide a unified framework that integrates learned priors with physical
forward models in a principled manner. Building upon this insight, we propose a
hybrid data-consistency module that linearly combines multiple PnP-style
fidelity terms. This hybrid correction is applied directly to the denoised
estimate, improving measurement consistency without disrupting the diffusion
sampling trajectory. Experimental results on single-pixel imaging tasks
demonstrate that our method achieves better reconstruction quality.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种全自动的两阶段框架，通过视神经夹直径测量和临床数据融合，实现了无创的内须压分级预测，显著提高了测量准确性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 内须压升高对脑功能构成严重威胁，需要及时监测。虽然腰穿刺是金标准测量方法，但其侵入性和风险促使需要无创备选方案。视神经夹直径作为有前途的生物标记物，但现有手工测量方法存在不一致性、主观性和变异性问题。

Method: 提出全自动两阶段框架：第一阶段进行眼底超声视频处理，包括框级解剖分割、基于规则的关键帧识别（遵循国际共识声明）和精确的ONSD测量；第二阶段融合ONSD指标和临床特征进行内须压分级预测。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法在验证集上达到准确度0.845±0.071（五折交叉验证），在独立测试集上达到0.786的准确度，显著超过传统阈值基方法（验证准0.637±0.111，测试准0.429）。

Conclusion: 通过有效减少操作变异性和融合多源信息，该框架为临床ICP评估建立了可靠的无创方法，有望改善急性神经系统疾病患者的管理水平。

Abstract: Intracranial pressure (ICP) elevation poses severe threats to cerebral
function, thus necessitating monitoring for timely intervention. While lumbar
puncture is the gold standard for ICP measurement, its invasiveness and
associated risks drive the need for non-invasive alternatives. Optic nerve
sheath diameter (ONSD) has emerged as a promising biomarker, as elevated ICP
directly correlates with increased ONSD. However, current clinical practices
for ONSD measurement suffer from inconsistency in manual operation,
subjectivity in optimal view selection, and variability in thresholding,
limiting their reliability. To address these challenges, we introduce a fully
automatic two-stage framework for ICP grading, integrating keyframe
identification, ONSD measurement and clinical data. Specifically, the fundus
ultrasound video processing stage performs frame-level anatomical segmentation,
rule-based keyframe identification guided by an international consensus
statement, and precise ONSD measurement. The intracranial pressure grading
stage then fuses ONSD metrics with clinical features to enable the prediction
of ICP grades, thereby demonstrating an innovative blend of interpretable
ultrasound analysis and multi-source data integration for objective clinical
evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves a
validation accuracy of $0.845 \pm 0.071$ (with standard deviation from
five-fold cross-validation) and an independent test accuracy of 0.786,
significantly outperforming conventional threshold-based method ($0.637 \pm
0.111$ validation accuracy, $0.429$ test accuracy). Through effectively
reducing operator variability and integrating multi-source information, our
framework establishes a reliable non-invasive approach for clinical ICP
evaluation, holding promise for improving patient management in acute
neurological conditions.

Motivation: 传统方法需要外部正常图像库对比，但IC布局异劣性大且对准困难，影响缺陷检测效果和稳定性

Method: 设计可学习正常信息提取器从测试图像聚合典型正常特征，使用一致性损失确保特征与正常区域关联，通过解码器重构正常内容，重构殊异用于缺陷分割，使用伪异常增广稳定训练

Result: 在三个IC制造流程步骤的数据集上均显示出比现有方法更一致的改进，并具有强大的对产品变异性的稳健性

Conclusion: 该方法免需外部正常数据支持，能够在异劣性大的IC图像中有效分割缺陷，为IC制造中的缺陷检测提供了一种更稳健可靠的无监督解决方案

Abstract: Modern Integrated-Circuit(IC) manufacturing introduces diverse, fine-grained
defects that depress yield and reliability. Most industrial defect segmentation
compares a test image against an external normal set, a strategy that is
brittle for IC imagery where layouts vary across products and accurate
alignment is difficult. We observe that defects are predominantly local, while
each image still contains rich, repeatable normal patterns. We therefore
propose an unsupervised IC defect segmentation framework that requires no
external normal support. A learnable normal-information extractor aggregates
representative normal features from the test image, and a coherence loss
enforces their association with normal regions. Guided by these features, a
decoder reconstructs only normal content; the reconstruction residual then
segments defects. Pseudo-anomaly augmentation further stabilizes training.
Experiments on datasets from three IC process stages show consistent
improvements over existing approaches and strong robustness to product
variability.

TL;DR: DRiFt是一个医学视觉语言模型的特征解耦框架，通过分离临床相关信号和任务无关噪声，提高模型在分布偏移下的鲁棒性和泛化能力。


<details>

Motivation: 医学视觉语言模型在临床决策支持中具有潜力，但由于成像协议和自由文本报告的变异性，模型容易学习任务无关的相关性，导致在真实世界环境中的泛化能力有限和失败风险增加。

Conclusion: 该方法有助于构建更安全、更可信的临床用视觉语言模型，为医学AI的安全部署提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Medical vision-language models (VLMs) offer promise for clinical decision
support, yet their reliability under distribution shifts remains a major
concern for safe deployment. These models often learn task-agnostic
correlations due to variability in imaging protocols and free-text reports,
limiting their generalizability and increasing the risk of failure in
real-world settings. We propose DRiFt, a structured feature decoupling
framework that explicitly separates clinically relevant signals from
task-agnostic noise using parameter-efficient tuning (LoRA) and learnable
prompt tokens. To enhance cross-modal alignment and reduce uncertainty, we
curate high-quality, clinically grounded image-text pairs by generating
captions for a diverse medical dataset. Our approach improves in-distribution
performance by +11.4% Top-1 accuracy and +3.3% Macro-F1 over prior prompt-based
methods, while maintaining strong robustness across unseen datasets. Ablation
studies reveal that disentangling task-relevant features and careful alignment
significantly enhance model generalization and reduce unpredictable behavior
under domain shift. These insights contribute toward building safer, more
trustworthy VLMs for clinical use. The code is available at

Motivation: 现实应用中多模态图像容易受到损坏，分辨率低且语义信息弱，现有融合技术效果不佳，需要同时解决图像融合和超分辨率问题

Method: 将图像融合和超分辨率统一为条件生成问题，使用清晰度感知机制进行语义引导，采用双向特征Mamba提取全局特征，通过改进的U-Net网络进行随机迭代去噪

Conclusion: FS-Diff通过语义引导和清晰度感知机制有效解决了多模态图像融合与超分辨率的联合问题，在军事侦察和远程检测等实际应用中具有重要价值

Abstract: As an influential information fusion and low-level vision technique, image
fusion integrates complementary information from source images to yield an
informative fused image. A few attempts have been made in recent years to
jointly realize image fusion and super-resolution. However, in real-world
applications such as military reconnaissance and long-range detection missions,
the target and background structures in multimodal images are easily corrupted,
with low resolution and weak semantic information, which leads to suboptimal
results in current fusion techniques. In response, we propose FS-Diff, a
semantic guidance and clarity-aware joint image fusion and super-resolution
method. FS-Diff unifies image fusion and super-resolution as a conditional
generation problem. It leverages semantic guidance from the proposed clarity
sensing mechanism for adaptive low-resolution perception and cross-modal
feature extraction. Specifically, we initialize the desired fused result as
pure Gaussian noise and introduce the bidirectional feature Mamba to extract
the global features of the multimodal images. Moreover, utilizing the source
images and semantics as conditions, we implement a random iterative denoising
process via a modified U-Net network. This network istrained for denoising at
multiple noise levels to produce high-resolution fusion results with
cross-modal features and abundant semantic information. We also construct a
powerful aerial view multiscene (AVMS) benchmark covering 600 pairs of images.
Extensive joint image fusion and super-resolution experiments on six public and
our AVMS datasets demonstrated that FS-Diff outperforms the state-of-the-art
methods at multiple magnifications and can recover richer details and semantics
in the fused images. The code is available at

Conclusion: 该方法通过显式语义集中成功解决了密集自监督学习中的过度分散问题，提高了密集任务的性能表现。

Abstract: Recent advances in image-level self-supervised learning (SSL) have made
significant progress, yet learning dense representations for patches remains
challenging. Mainstream methods encounter an over-dispersion phenomenon that
patches from the same instance/category scatter, harming downstream performance
on dense tasks. This work reveals that image-level SSL avoids over-dispersion
by involving implicit semantic concentration. Specifically, the non-strict
spatial alignment ensures intra-instance consistency, while shared patterns,
i.e., similar parts of within-class instances in the input space, ensure
inter-image consistency. Unfortunately, these approaches are infeasible for
dense SSL due to their spatial sensitivity and complicated scene-centric data.
These observations motivate us to explore explicit semantic concentration for
dense SSL. First, to break the strict spatial alignment, we propose to distill
the patch correspondences. Facing noisy and imbalanced pseudo labels, we
propose a noise-tolerant ranking loss. The core idea is extending the Average
Precision (AP) loss to continuous targets, such that its decision-agnostic and
adaptive focusing properties prevent the student model from being misled.
Second, to discriminate the shared patterns from complicated scenes, we propose
the object-aware filter to map the output space to an object-based space.
Specifically, patches are represented by learnable prototypes of objects via
cross-attention. Last but not least, empirical studies across various tasks
soundly support the effectiveness of our method. Code is available in

Abstract: Different modalities of medical images provide unique physiological and
anatomical information for diseases. Multi-modal medical image fusion
integrates useful information from different complementary medical images with
different modalities, producing a fused image that comprehensively and
objectively reflects lesion characteristics to assist doctors in clinical
diagnosis. However, existing fusion methods can only handle a fixed number of
modality inputs, such as accepting only two-modal or tri-modal inputs, and
cannot directly process varying input quantities, which hinders their
application in clinical settings. To tackle this issue, we introduce
FlexiD-Fuse, a diffusion-based image fusion network designed to accommodate
flexible quantities of input modalities. It can end-to-end process two-modal
and tri-modal medical image fusion under the same weight. FlexiD-Fuse
transforms the diffusion fusion problem, which supports only fixed-condition
inputs, into a maximum likelihood estimation problem based on the diffusion
process and hierarchical Bayesian modeling. By incorporating the
Expectation-Maximization algorithm into the diffusion sampling iteration
process, FlexiD-Fuse can generate high-quality fused images with cross-modal
information from source images, independently of the number of input images. We
compared the latest two and tri-modal medical image fusion methods, tested them
on Harvard datasets, and evaluated them using nine popular metrics. The
experimental results show that our method achieves the best performance in
medical image fusion with varying inputs. Meanwhile, we conducted extensive
extension experiments on infrared-visible, multi-exposure, and multi-focus
image fusion tasks with arbitrary numbers, and compared them with the
perspective SOTA methods. The results of the extension experiments consistently
demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method.

Abstract: Deepfakes, synthetic media created using advanced AI techniques, have
intensified the spread of misinformation, particularly in politically sensitive
contexts. Existing deepfake detection datasets are often limited, relying on
outdated generation methods, low realism, or single-face imagery, restricting
the effectiveness for general synthetic image detection. By analyzing social
media posts, we identify multiple modalities through which deepfakes propagate
misinformation. Furthermore, our human perception study demonstrates that
recently developed proprietary models produce synthetic images increasingly
indistinguishable from real ones, complicating accurate identification by the
general public. Consequently, we present a comprehensive, politically-focused
dataset specifically crafted for benchmarking detection against modern
generative models. This dataset contains three million real images paired with
descriptive captions, which are used for generating 963k corresponding
high-quality synthetic images from a mix of proprietary and open-source models.
Recognizing the continual evolution of generative techniques, we introduce an
innovative crowdsourced adversarial platform, where participants are
incentivized to generate and submit challenging synthetic images. This ongoing
community-driven initiative ensures that deepfake detection methods remain
robust and adaptive, proactively safeguarding public discourse from
sophisticated misinformation threats.

Abstract: Gliomas are the most prevalent type of primary brain tumors, and their
accurate segmentation from MRI is critical for diagnosis, treatment planning,
and longitudinal monitoring. However, the scarcity of high-quality annotated
imaging data in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) poses a significant challenge for
deploying advanced segmentation models in clinical workflows. This study
introduces a robust and computationally efficient deep learning framework
tailored for resource-constrained settings. We leveraged a 3D Attention UNet
architecture augmented with residual blocks and enhanced through transfer
learning from pre-trained weights on the BraTS 2021 dataset. Our model was
evaluated on 95 MRI cases from the BraTS-Africa dataset, a benchmark for glioma
segmentation in SSA MRI data. Despite the limited data quality and quantity,
our approach achieved Dice scores of 0.76 for the Enhancing Tumor (ET), 0.80
for Necrotic and Non-Enhancing Tumor Core (NETC), and 0.85 for Surrounding
Non-Functional Hemisphere (SNFH). These results demonstrate the
generalizability of the proposed model and its potential to support clinical
decision making in low-resource settings. The compact architecture,
approximately 90 MB, and sub-minute per-volume inference time on consumer-grade
hardware further underscore its practicality for deployment in SSA health
systems. This work contributes toward closing the gap in equitable AI for
global health by empowering underserved regions with high-performing and

Conclusion: 动量约束提供了一种物理基础的方法来关联局部关节行为与全局位移，有效解决了局部与全局运动耦合的建模问题。

Abstract: Many studies decompose human motion into local motion in a frame attached to
the root joint and global motion of the root joint in the world frame, treating
them separately. However, these two components are not independent. Global
movement arises from interactions with the environment, which are, in turn,
driven by changes in the body configuration. Motion models often fail to
precisely capture this physical coupling between local and global dynamics,
while deriving global trajectories from joint torques and external forces is
computationally expensive and complex. To address these challenges, we propose
using whole-body linear and angular momentum as a constraint to link local
motion with global movement. Since momentum reflects the aggregate effect of
joint-level dynamics on the body's movement through space, it provides a
physically grounded way to relate local joint behavior to global displacement.
Building on this insight, we introduce a new loss term that enforces
consistency between the generated momentum profiles and those observed in
ground-truth data. Incorporating our loss reduces foot sliding and jitter,
improves balance, and preserves the accuracy of the recovered motion. Code and
data are available at the project page https://hlinhn.github.io/momentum_bmvc.

Abstract: Understanding region-wise correspondence between manga line art images is a
fundamental task in manga processing, enabling downstream applications such as
automatic line art colorization and in-between frame generation. However, this
task remains largely unexplored, especially in realistic scenarios without
pre-existing segmentation or annotations. In this paper, we introduce a novel
and practical task: predicting region-wise correspondence between raw manga
line art images without any pre-existing labels or masks. To tackle this
problem, we divide each line art image into a set of patches and propose a
Transformer-based framework that learns patch-level similarities within and
across images. We then apply edge-aware clustering and a region matching
algorithm to convert patch-level predictions into coherent region-level
correspondences. To support training and evaluation, we develop an automatic
annotation pipeline and manually refine a subset of the data to construct
benchmark datasets. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that our
method achieves high patch-level accuracy (e.g., 96.34%) and generates
consistent region-level correspondences, highlighting its potential for
real-world manga applications.

Abstract: In recent years, Multi-View Clustering (MVC) has been significantly advanced
under the influence of deep learning. By integrating heterogeneous data from
multiple views, MVC enhances clustering analysis, making multi-view fusion
critical to clustering performance. However, there is a problem of low-quality
data in multi-view fusion. This problem primarily arises from two reasons: 1)
Certain views are contaminated by noisy data. 2) Some views suffer from missing
data. This paper proposes a novel Stochastic Generative Diffusion Fusion (SGDF)
method to address this problem. SGDF leverages a multiple generative mechanism
for the multi-view feature of each sample. It is robust to low-quality data.
Building on SGDF, we further present the Generative Diffusion Contrastive
Network (GDCN). Extensive experiments show that GDCN achieves the
state-of-the-art results in deep MVC tasks. The source code is publicly

Abstract: Three-dimensional ultrasound (US) offers many clinical advantages over
conventional 2D imaging, yet its widespread adoption is limited by the cost and
complexity of traditional 3D systems. Sensorless 3D US, which uses deep
learning to estimate a 3D probe trajectory from a sequence of 2D US images, is
a promising alternative. Local features, such as speckle patterns, can help
predict frame-to-frame motion, while global features, such as coarse shapes and
anatomical structures, can situate the scan relative to anatomy and help
predict its general shape. In prior approaches, global features are either
ignored or tightly coupled with local feature extraction, restricting the
ability to robustly model these two complementary aspects. We propose
DualTrack, a novel dual-encoder architecture that leverages decoupled local and
global encoders specialized for their respective scales of feature extraction.
The local encoder uses dense spatiotemporal convolutions to capture
fine-grained features, while the global encoder utilizes an image backbone
(e.g., a 2D CNN or foundation model) and temporal attention layers to embed
high-level anatomical features and long-range dependencies. A lightweight

Motivation: 当前视频扩散模型主要关注架构创新和训练目标改进，而忽视了特征表示能力的提升。研究发现将视频生成器的中间特征与预训练视觉编码器的特征表示对齐可以带来好处

Method: 提出新指标深入分析各种视觉编码器的判别性和时间一致性，基于分析结果开发Align4Gen方法，包含多特征融合和对齐机制，集成到视频扩散模型训练中

Conclusion: 特征对齐是提升视频扩散模型性能的有效方法，Align4Gen通过多特征融合和对齐机制显著改善了视频生成效果

Abstract: Video diffusion models have advanced rapidly in the recent years as a result
of series of architectural innovations (e.g., diffusion transformers) and use
of novel training objectives (e.g., flow matching). In contrast, less attention
has been paid to improving the feature representation power of such models. In
this work, we show that training video diffusion models can benefit from
aligning the intermediate features of the video generator with feature
representations of pre-trained vision encoders. We propose a new metric and
conduct an in-depth analysis of various vision encoders to evaluate their
discriminability and temporal consistency, thereby assessing their suitability
for video feature alignment. Based on the analysis, we present Align4Gen which
provides a novel multi-feature fusion and alignment method integrated into
video diffusion model training. We evaluate Align4Gen both for unconditional
and class-conditional video generation tasks and show that it results in
improved video generation as quantified by various metrics. Full video results

Motivation: 现有的人-物交互数据集存在质量问题和标注不足，如接触穿透、漂浮和错误手部动作等缺陷，限制了3D人-物交互生成模型的发展。

Method: 1) 整合和标准化21.81小时的多源HOI数据并添加详细文本标注；2) 提出统一优化框架，基于接触不变性原理减少伪影并修正手部动作，同时保持人-物关系并引入运动变化；3) 定义六个基准任务并开发统一的HOI生成建模视角。

Conclusion: InterAct数据集解决了现有HOI数据集的局限性，为推进3D人-物交互生成研究提供了高质量的基础资源，该数据集已公开并持续维护。

Abstract: While large-scale human motion capture datasets have advanced human motion
generation, modeling and generating dynamic 3D human-object interactions (HOIs)
remain challenging due to dataset limitations. Existing datasets often lack
extensive, high-quality motion and annotation and exhibit artifacts such as
contact penetration, floating, and incorrect hand motions. To address these
issues, we introduce InterAct, a large-scale 3D HOI benchmark featuring dataset
and methodological advancements. First, we consolidate and standardize 21.81
hours of HOI data from diverse sources, enriching it with detailed textual
annotations. Second, we propose a unified optimization framework to enhance
data quality by reducing artifacts and correcting hand motions. Leveraging the
principle of contact invariance, we maintain human-object relationships while
introducing motion variations, expanding the dataset to 30.70 hours. Third, we
define six benchmarking tasks and develop a unified HOI generative modeling
perspective, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Extensive experiments
validate the utility of our dataset as a foundational resource for advancing 3D
human-object interaction generation. To support continued research in this
area, the dataset is publicly available at
https://github.com/wzyabcas/InterAct, and will be actively maintained.

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了基于深度学习的阿尔茨海默病MRI诊断中存在的种族和性别相关捷径学习与偏见问题，通过多数据集和模型验证了这种偏见的存在，并提出了更公平诊断工具的基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习算法在MRI脑部成像诊断中可能受到捷径学习影响，使用与输出标签无关的虚假特征进行预测，当这些特征与受保护属性相关时，会导致对 underrepresented 群体的性能偏见。

Method: 首先研究DL算法能否从3D脑MRI扫描中识别种族或性别以确认分布偏移；然后调查训练集种族或性别不平衡是否导致模型性能下降；最后对受保护属性和AD分类任务进行脑区特征归因的定量和定性分析。使用ResNet和SwinTransformer等多种DL模型和数据集。

Result: 实验证明基于深度学习的AD分类中存在种族和性别相关的捷径学习与偏见。

Conclusion: 该工作为开发更公平的脑MRI深度学习诊断工具奠定了基础，提供了相关代码供进一步研究。

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the gold standard for brain imaging. Deep
learning (DL) algorithms have been proposed to aid in the diagnosis of diseases
such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) from MRI scans. However, DL algorithms can
suffer from shortcut learning, in which spurious features, not directly related
to the output label, are used for prediction. When these features are related
to protected attributes, they can lead to performance bias against
underrepresented protected groups, such as those defined by race and sex. In
this work, we explore the potential for shortcut learning and demographic bias
in DL based AD diagnosis from MRI. We first investigate if DL algorithms can
identify race or sex from 3D brain MRI scans to establish the presence or
otherwise of race and sex based distributional shifts. Next, we investigate
whether training set imbalance by race or sex can cause a drop in model
performance, indicating shortcut learning and bias. Finally, we conduct a
quantitative and qualitative analysis of feature attributions in different
brain regions for both the protected attribute and AD classification tasks.
Through these experiments, and using multiple datasets and DL models (ResNet
and SwinTransformer), we demonstrate the existence of both race and sex based
shortcut learning and bias in DL based AD classification. Our work lays the
foundation for fairer DL diagnostic tools in brain MRI. The code is provided at

Method: 采用权重共享的Siamese编码器架构，集成LoRA和Adapter模块进行参数高效微调，使用SAM2和DINOv3作为骨干网络，配合轻量级解码器

Result: 在多个公开数据集上取得优异性能：SYSU-CD(IoU 73.81%)、WHUCD(92.05%)、MSRSCD(64.07%)、MLCD(76.89%)、CDD(97.01%)、S2Looking(52.25%)和LEVIR-CD(85.62%)，具有精确边界划分和强伪变化抑制能力

Conclusion: PeftCD在准确性、效率和泛化性之间实现了最佳平衡，为大规模VFM适应真实遥感变化检测应用提供了强大且可扩展的范式

Abstract: To tackle the prevalence of pseudo changes, the scarcity of labeled samples,
and the difficulty of cross-domain generalization in multi-temporal and
multi-source remote sensing imagery, we propose PeftCD, a change detection
framework built upon Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) with Parameter-Efficient
Fine-Tuning (PEFT). At its core, PeftCD employs a weight-sharing Siamese
encoder derived from a VFM, into which LoRA and Adapter modules are seamlessly
integrated. This design enables highly efficient task adaptation by training
only a minimal set of additional parameters. To fully unlock the potential of
VFMs, we investigate two leading backbones: the Segment Anything Model v2
(SAM2), renowned for its strong segmentation priors, and DINOv3, a
state-of-the-art self-supervised representation learner. The framework is
complemented by a deliberately lightweight decoder, ensuring the focus remains
on the powerful feature representations from the backbones. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that PeftCD achieves state-of-the-art performance
across multiple public datasets, including SYSU-CD (IoU 73.81%), WHUCD
(92.05%), MSRSCD (64.07%), MLCD (76.89%), CDD (97.01%), S2Looking (52.25%) and
LEVIR-CD (85.62%), with notably precise boundary delineation and strong
suppression of pseudo-changes. In summary, PeftCD presents an optimal balance
of accuracy, efficiency, and generalization. It offers a powerful and scalable
paradigm for adapting large-scale VFMs to real-world remote sensing change
detection applications. The code and pretrained models will be released at

TL;DR: Kling-Avatar是一个新颖的级联框架，通过多模态指令理解和照片级真实感人像生成的统一，解决了现有音频驱动虚拟人视频生成方法在叙事连贯性和角色表现力方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将指令条件仅视为由声学或视觉线索驱动的低级跟踪，而没有建模指令传达的交流目的，这限制了叙事的连贯性和角色表现力。

Method: 采用两阶段流水线：第一阶段设计多模态大语言模型导演，基于多样化指令信号生成蓝图视频；第二阶段在蓝图关键帧指导下，使用首尾帧策略并行生成多个子片段。

Result: 能够生成生动、流畅、长时长的1080p 48fps视频，在唇形同步精度、情感和动态表现力、指令可控性、身份保持和跨域泛化方面表现优异。

Conclusion: Kling-Avatar为语义基础的高保真音频驱动虚拟人合成建立了新的基准，适用于数字人直播和视频博客等实际应用。

Abstract: Recent advances in audio-driven avatar video generation have significantly
enhanced audio-visual realism. However, existing methods treat instruction
conditioning merely as low-level tracking driven by acoustic or visual cues,
without modeling the communicative purpose conveyed by the instructions. This
limitation compromises their narrative coherence and character expressiveness.
To bridge this gap, we introduce Kling-Avatar, a novel cascaded framework that
unifies multimodal instruction understanding with photorealistic portrait
generation. Our approach adopts a two-stage pipeline. In the first stage, we
design a multimodal large language model (MLLM) director that produces a
blueprint video conditioned on diverse instruction signals, thereby governing
high-level semantics such as character motion and emotions. In the second
stage, guided by blueprint keyframes, we generate multiple sub-clips in
parallel using a first-last frame strategy. This global-to-local framework
preserves fine-grained details while faithfully encoding the high-level intent
behind multimodal instructions. Our parallel architecture also enables fast and
stable generation of long-duration videos, making it suitable for real-world
applications such as digital human livestreaming and vlogging. To
comprehensively evaluate our method, we construct a benchmark of 375 curated
samples covering diverse instructions and challenging scenarios. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that Kling-Avatar is capable of generating vivid,
fluent, long-duration videos at up to 1080p and 48 fps, achieving superior
performance in lip synchronization accuracy, emotion and dynamic
expressiveness, instruction controllability, identity preservation, and
cross-domain generalization. These results establish Kling-Avatar as a new
benchmark for semantically grounded, high-fidelity audio-driven avatar
synthesis.

Motivation: 预测脑肿瘤的时空进展对于指导神经肿瘤学临床决策至关重要，需要生成解剖学可行的未来MRI图像来辅助治疗规划

Method: 使用常微分方程系统的机制模型捕捉肿瘤时间动态（包括放疗效果），结合梯度引导的DDIM模型进行图像合成，确保与预测生长和患者解剖结构对齐

Result: 在BraTS成人和儿童胶质瘤数据集上训练，在60个儿童弥漫中线胶质瘤病例上评估，生成真实随访扫描，提供肿瘤生长概率图，显示临床相关生长范围和方向性

Conclusion: 该方法在数据有限情况下实现生物学信息图像生成，提供考虑机制先验的生成时空预测，为临床决策提供支持

Abstract: Predicting the spatio-temporal progression of brain tumors is essential for
guiding clinical decisions in neuro-oncology. We propose a hybrid mechanistic
learning framework that combines a mathematical tumor growth model with a
guided denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM) to synthesize anatomically
feasible future MRIs from preceding scans. The mechanistic model, formulated as
a system of ordinary differential equations, captures temporal tumor dynamics
including radiotherapy effects and estimates future tumor burden. These
estimates condition a gradient-guided DDIM, enabling image synthesis that
aligns with both predicted growth and patient anatomy. We train our model on
the BraTS adult and pediatric glioma datasets and evaluate on 60 axial slices
of in-house longitudinal pediatric diffuse midline glioma (DMG) cases. Our
framework generates realistic follow-up scans based on spatial similarity
metrics. It also introduces tumor growth probability maps, which capture both
clinically relevant extent and directionality of tumor growth as shown by 95th
percentile Hausdorff Distance. The method enables biologically informed image
generation in data-limited scenarios, offering generative-space-time
predictions that account for mechanistic priors.

Motivation: 现有基准测试主要测试识别准确率，忽略了模型拒绝错误选项的关键能力，这在安全关键应用中至关重要。多模态大语言模型的幻觉问题会导致错误信息和决策风险。

Method: 基于全景场景图数据集，利用细粒度场景图标注提取真实实体和关系，使用GPT-4-Turbo生成多项选择题，并经过严格人工筛选。每个问题包含"以上都不是"选项。

Result: 评估了多种最先进的多模态大语言模型（包括通用和专用推理模型），提供了有价值的发现和见解。

Conclusion: HumbleBench通过引入显式的错误选项拒绝机制，填补了当前评估套件的关键空白，为安全关键环境中的MLLM可靠性提供了更真实的衡量标准。

Abstract: Hallucinations in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) -- where the model
generates content inconsistent with the input image -- pose significant risks
in real-world applications, from misinformation in visual question answering to
unsafe errors in decision-making. Existing benchmarks primarily test
recognition accuracy, i.e., evaluating whether models can select the correct
answer among distractors. This overlooks an equally critical capability for
trustworthy AI: recognizing when none of the provided options are correct, a
behavior reflecting epistemic humility. We present HumbleBench, a new
hallucination benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' ability to reject plausible
but incorrect answers across three hallucination types: object, relation, and
attribute. Built from a panoptic scene graph dataset, we leverage fine-grained
scene graph annotations to extract ground-truth entities and relations, and
prompt GPT-4-Turbo to generate multiple-choice questions, followed by a
rigorous manual filtering process. Each question includes a "None of the above"
option, requiring models not only to recognize correct visual information but
also to identify when no provided answer is valid. We evaluate a variety of
state-of-the-art MLLMs -- including both general-purpose and specialized
reasoning models -- on HumbleBench and share valuable findings and insights
with the community. By incorporating explicit false-option rejection,
HumbleBench fills a key gap in current evaluation suites, providing a more
realistic measure of MLLM reliability in safety-critical settings. Our code and
dataset are released publicly and can be accessed at

TL;DR: 通过自动编码器视角，将图像理解作为编码器（I2T）压缩图像为文本，生成作为解码器（T2I）从文本重建图像，以重建保真度为统一训练目标实现双向信息流和相互提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过统一的多模态学习框架UAE，强化理解和生成过程之间的双向信息流，带来相互收益。以重建保真度作为统一训练目标，提高模型的视觉理解能力和生成质量。

Method: 提出UAE框架：首先用大规模长上下文图像描述预训练解码器，捐捕细粒度语义和复杂空间关系；然后通过加强学习提出Unified-GRPO方法，包括冷启动阶段、生成促进理解阶段和理解促进生成阶段，使编码器和解码器相互优化。

Result: 在加强学习过程中，编码器自主产生更描述性的文本描述，而解码器能够理解这些复杂描述并生成高保真度的图像重建。还提出了专门评估UMM统一性的Unified-Bench标准。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种新的多模态学习范式，通过理解与生成的双向协同训练，实现了两者的相互提升，为统一多模态模型的发展提供了有力的方法论基础。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce an insightful paradigm through the Auto-Encoder
lens-understanding as the encoder (I2T) that compresses images into text, and
generation as the decoder (T2I) that reconstructs images from that text. Using
reconstruction fidelity as the unified training objective, we enforce the
coherent bidirectional information flow between the understanding and
generation processes, bringing mutual gains. To implement this, we propose UAE,
a novel framework for unified multimodal learning. We begin by pre-training the
decoder with large-scale long-context image captions to capture fine-grained
semantic and complex spatial relationships. We then propose Unified-GRPO via
reinforcement learning (RL), which covers three stages: (1) A cold-start phase
to gently initialize both encoder and decoder with a semantic reconstruction
loss; (2) Generation for Understanding, where the encoder is trained to
generate informative captions that maximize the decoder's reconstruction
quality, enhancing its visual understanding; (3) Understanding for Generation,
where the decoder is refined to reconstruct from these captions, forcing it to
leverage every detail and improving its long-context instruction following and
generation fidelity. For evaluation, we introduce Unified-Bench, the first
benchmark tailored to assess the degree of unification of the UMMs. A
surprising "aha moment" arises within the multimodal learning domain: as RL
progresses, the encoder autonomously produces more descriptive captions, while
the decoder simultaneously demonstrates a profound ability to understand these
intricate descriptions, resulting in reconstructions of striking fidelity.

Abstract: We introduce Neural Riemannian Motion Fields (NRMF), a novel 3D generative
human motion prior that enables robust, temporally consistent, and physically
plausible 3D motion recovery. Unlike existing VAE or diffusion-based methods,
our higher-order motion prior explicitly models the human motion in the zero
level set of a collection of neural distance fields (NDFs) corresponding to
pose, transition (velocity), and acceleration dynamics. Our framework is
rigorous in the sense that our NDFs are constructed on the product space of
joint rotations, their angular velocities, and angular accelerations,
respecting the geometry of the underlying articulations. We further introduce:
(i) a novel adaptive-step hybrid algorithm for projecting onto the set of
plausible motions, and (ii) a novel geometric integrator to "roll out"
realistic motion trajectories during test-time-optimization and generation. Our
experiments show significant and consistent gains: trained on the AMASS
dataset, NRMF remarkably generalizes across multiple input modalities and to
diverse tasks ranging from denoising to motion in-betweening and fitting to

Conclusion: 扩散模型中的局部性源于图像数据集的像素相关性统计特性，而非卷积网络的归纳偏置，这一发现有助于设计更准确的解析模型。

Abstract: Among generative models, diffusion models are uniquely intriguing due to the
existence of a closed-form optimal minimizer of their training objective, often
referred to as the optimal denoiser. However, diffusion using this optimal
denoiser merely reproduces images in the training set and hence fails to
capture the behavior of deep diffusion models. Recent work has attempted to
characterize this gap between the optimal denoiser and deep diffusion models,
proposing analytical, training-free models that can generate images that
resemble those generated by a trained UNet. The best-performing method
hypothesizes that shift equivariance and locality inductive biases of
convolutional neural networks are the cause of the performance gap, hence
incorporating these assumptions into its analytical model. In this work, we
present evidence that the locality in deep diffusion models emerges as a
statistical property of the image dataset, not due to the inductive bias of
convolutional neural networks. Specifically, we demonstrate that an optimal
parametric linear denoiser exhibits similar locality properties to the deep
neural denoisers. We further show, both theoretically and experimentally, that
this locality arises directly from the pixel correlations present in natural
image datasets. Finally, we use these insights to craft an analytical denoiser
that better matches scores predicted by a deep diffusion model than the prior
expert-crafted alternative.

Abstract: Significant progress has been made in spatial intelligence, spanning both
spatial reconstruction and world exploration. However, the scalability and
real-world fidelity of current models remain severely constrained by the
scarcity of large-scale, high-quality training data. While several datasets
provide camera pose information, they are typically limited in scale,
diversity, and annotation richness, particularly for real-world dynamic scenes
with ground-truth camera motion. To this end, we collect \textbf{SpatialVID}, a
dataset consists of a large corpus of in-the-wild videos with diverse scenes,
camera movements and dense 3D annotations such as per-frame camera poses,
depth, and motion instructions. Specifically, we collect more than 21,000 hours
of raw video, and process them into 2.7 million clips through a hierarchical
filtering pipeline, totaling 7,089 hours of dynamic content. A subsequent
annotation pipeline enriches these clips with detailed spatial and semantic
information, including camera poses, depth maps, dynamic masks, structured
captions, and serialized motion instructions. Analysis of SpatialVID's data
statistics reveals a richness and diversity that directly foster improved model
generalization and performance, establishing it as a key asset for the video

Abstract: The advancement of open-source text-to-image (T2I) models has been hindered
by the absence of large-scale, reasoning-focused datasets and comprehensive
evaluation benchmarks, resulting in a performance gap compared to leading
closed-source systems. To address this challenge, We introduce FLUX-Reason-6M
and PRISM-Bench (Precise and Robust Image Synthesis Measurement Benchmark).
FLUX-Reason-6M is a massive dataset consisting of 6 million high-quality
FLUX-generated images and 20 million bilingual (English and Chinese)
descriptions specifically designed to teach complex reasoning. The image are
organized according to six key characteristics: Imagination, Entity, Text
rendering, Style, Affection, and Composition, and design explicit Generation
Chain-of-Thought (GCoT) to provide detailed breakdowns of image generation
steps. The whole data curation takes 15,000 A100 GPU days, providing the
community with a resource previously unattainable outside of large industrial
labs. PRISM-Bench offers a novel evaluation standard with seven distinct
tracks, including a formidable Long Text challenge using GCoT. Through
carefully designed prompts, it utilizes advanced vision-language models for
nuanced human-aligned assessment of prompt-image alignment and image
aesthetics. Our extensive evaluation of 19 leading models on PRISM-Bench
reveals critical performance gaps and highlights specific areas requiring
improvement. Our dataset, benchmark, and evaluation code are released to

Motivation: 解决在通信能力有限（发送速率和包载荷受限）、环境高度部分可观测且存在主动障碍物的多智能体系统中，任务频繁重分配的问题

Method: 受市场机制启发的新型分布式协调算法，特别考虑非对称障碍物，在通信条件差的环境中进行高效任务分配

Conclusion: 该方法能有效处理通信受限、部分可观测环境中的非对称主动障碍物问题，提高多智能体系统协调效率

Abstract: Coordinating a fully distributed multi-agent system (MAS) can be challenging
when the communication channel has very limited capabilities in terms of
sending rate and packet payload. When the MAS has to deal with active obstacles
in a highly partially observable environment, the communication channel
acquires considerable relevance. In this paper, we present an approach to deal
with task assignments in extremely active scenarios, where tasks need to be
frequently reallocated among the agents participating in the coordination
process. Inspired by market-based task assignments, we introduce a novel
distributed coordination method to orchestrate autonomous agents' actions
efficiently in low communication scenarios. In particular, our algorithm takes
into account asymmetric obstacles. While in the real world, the majority of
obstacles are asymmetric, they are usually treated as symmetric ones, thus
limiting the applicability of existing methods. To summarize, the presented
architecture is designed to tackle scenarios where the obstacles are active and
asymmetric, the communication channel is poor and the environment is partially
observable. Our approach has been validated in simulation and in the real
world, using a team of NAO robots during official RoboCup competitions.
Experimental results show a notable reduction in task overlaps in limited
communication settings, with a decrease of 52% in the most frequent reallocated
task.

Method: 使用3D纤维缆绕技术（3DFiT）制造面心立方格子结构旗般机架，确保连续单纽纤维的精确排列

Result: 旗般机架仅重260g，比DJI F450轻10%，特异强度远超金属和热塑性材料，飞行时间延长3分钟，飞行测试证明其稳定性和耐用性

Conclusion: 单纽格子架构旗般机架具有很大潜力，3DFiT技术作为一种可扩展的高效制造方法

Abstract: The demand for lightweight and high-strength composite structures is rapidly
growing in aerospace and robotics, particularly for optimized drone frames.
However, conventional composite manufacturing methods struggle to achieve
complex 3D architectures for weight savings and rely on assembling separate
components, which introduce weak points at the joints. Additionally,
maintaining continuous fiber reinforcement remains challenging, limiting
structural efficiency. In this study, we demonstrate the lightweight Face
Centered Cubic (FFC) lattice structured conceptualization of drone frames for
weight reduction and complex topology fabrication through 3D Fiber Tethering
(3DFiT) using continuous single tow fiber ensuring precise fiber alignment,
eliminating weak points associated with traditional composite assembly.
Mechanical testing demonstrates that the fabricated drone frame exhibits a high
specific strength of around four to eight times the metal and thermoplastic,
outperforming other conventional 3D printing methods. The drone frame weighs
only 260 g, making it 10% lighter than the commercial DJI F450 frame, enhancing
structural integrity and contributing to an extended flight time of three
minutes, while flight testing confirms its stability and durability under
operational conditions. The findings demonstrate the potential of single tow
lattice truss-based drone frames, with 3DFiT serving as a scalable and
efficient manufacturing method.

*Alice Kate Li,Thales C Silva,Victoria Edwards,Vijay Kumar,M. Ani Hsieh*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: KoopMotion是一种基于流场的运动规划方法，使用Koopman算子理论来学习期望轨迹的动态系统表示，能够从任意初始状态驱动机器人收敛到目标轨迹的终点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然Koopman算子理论在动态系统建模中表现出色，但它本身不能保证收敛到期望轨迹或指定目标，这在从演示学习(LfD)中是必需的要求。

Method: 将运动流场表示为动态系统，通过Koopman算子参数化来模仿期望轨迹，利用学习到的流场的发散特性获得平滑的运动场，使机器人能够收敛到参考轨迹并跟踪到终点。

Result: 在LASA手写数据集和3D机械臂末端轨迹数据集上进行了评估，包括频谱分析；在物理机器人上验证了在非静态流体环境中的性能；仅需LASA数据集的3%就能生成密集运动规划，在时空动态建模效果指标上显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: KoopMotion方法具有高度的样本效率，能够有效生成收敛到目标轨迹的运动规划，在复杂环境中表现出色。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel flow field-based motion planning method that
drives a robot from any initial state to a desired reference trajectory such
that it converges to the trajectory's end point. Despite demonstrated efficacy
in using Koopman operator theory for modeling dynamical systems, Koopman does
not inherently enforce convergence to desired trajectories nor to specified
goals -- a requirement when learning from demonstrations (LfD). We present
KoopMotion which represents motion flow fields as dynamical systems,
parameterized by Koopman Operators to mimic desired trajectories, and leverages
the divergence properties of the learnt flow fields to obtain smooth motion
fields that converge to a desired reference trajectory when a robot is placed
away from the desired trajectory, and tracks the trajectory until the end
point. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we show evaluations of
KoopMotion on the LASA human handwriting dataset and a 3D manipulator
end-effector trajectory dataset, including spectral analysis. We also perform
experiments on a physical robot, verifying KoopMotion on a miniature autonomous
surface vehicle operating in a non-static fluid flow environment. Our approach
is highly sample efficient in both space and time, requiring only 3\% of the
LASA dataset to generate dense motion plans. Additionally, KoopMotion provides
a significant improvement over baselines when comparing metrics that measure
spatial and temporal dynamics modeling efficacy.

Conclusion: 欠驱动变形机构在需要高效、适应性强的加载应用中具有实际潜力，所提出的通用建模和优化框架可扩展到更广泛的机械臂类别，为机器人系统开发提供可扩展方法。

Abstract: Fixed degree-of-freedom (DoF) loading mechanisms often suffer from excessive
actuators, complex control, and limited adaptability to dynamic tasks. This
study proposes an innovative mechanism of underactuated metamorphic loading
manipulators (UMLM), integrating a metamorphic arm with a passively adaptive
gripper. The metamorphic arm exploits geometric constraints, enabling the
topology reconfiguration and flexible motion trajectories without additional
actuators. The adaptive gripper, driven entirely by the arm, conforms to
diverse objects through passive compliance. A structural model is developed,
and a kinetostatics analysis is conducted to investigate isomorphic grasping
configurations. To optimize performance, Particle-Swarm Optimization (PSO) is
utilized to refine the gripper's dimensional parameters, ensuring robust
adaptability across various applications. Simulation results validate the
UMLM's easily implemented control strategy, operational versatility, and
effectiveness in grasping diverse objects in dynamic environments. This work
underscores the practical potential of underactuated metamorphic mechanisms in
applications requiring efficient and adaptable loading solutions. Beyond the
specific design, this generalized modeling and optimization framework extends
to a broader class of manipulators, offering a scalable approach to the
development of robotic systems that require efficiency, flexibility, and robust
performance.

Conclusion: 基于LIPM的奖励设计方法有效提升了双足机器人在野外环境中的感知运动稳定性和鲁棒性

Abstract: Achieving stable and robust perceptive locomotion for bipedal robots in
unstructured outdoor environments remains a critical challenge due to complex
terrain geometry and susceptibility to external disturbances. In this work, we
propose a novel reward design inspired by the Linear Inverted Pendulum Model
(LIPM) to enable perceptive and stable locomotion in the wild. The LIPM
provides theoretical guidance for dynamic balance by regulating the center of
mass (CoM) height and the torso orientation. These are key factors for
terrain-aware locomotion, as they help ensure a stable viewpoint for the
robot's camera. Building on this insight, we design a reward function that
promotes balance and dynamic stability while encouraging accurate CoM
trajectory tracking. To adaptively trade off between velocity tracking and
stability, we leverage the Reward Fusion Module (RFM) approach that prioritizes
stability when needed. A double-critic architecture is adopted to separately
evaluate stability and locomotion objectives, improving training efficiency and
robustness. We validate our approach through extensive experiments on a bipedal
robot in both simulation and real-world outdoor environments. The results
demonstrate superior terrain adaptability, disturbance rejection, and
consistent performance across a wide range of speeds and perceptual conditions.

Conclusion: AEOS框架通过生物启发的自适应扫描策略，有效解决了复杂遮挡环境中LiDAR里程计性能下降的问题，实现了计算高效的实时自适应控制

Abstract: LiDAR-based 3D perception and localization on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)
are fundamentally limited by the narrow field of view (FoV) of compact LiDAR
sensors and the payload constraints that preclude multi-sensor configurations.
Traditional motorized scanning systems with fixed-speed rotations lack scene
awareness and task-level adaptability, leading to degraded odometry and mapping
performance in complex, occluded environments. Inspired by the active sensing
behavior of owls, we propose AEOS (Active Environment-aware Optimal Scanning),
a biologically inspired and computationally efficient framework for adaptive
LiDAR control in UAV-based LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (LIO). AEOS combines model
predictive control (MPC) and reinforcement learning (RL) in a hybrid
architecture: an analytical uncertainty model predicts future pose
observability for exploitation, while a lightweight neural network learns an
implicit cost map from panoramic depth representations to guide exploration. To
support scalable training and generalization, we develop a point cloud-based
simulation environment with real-world LiDAR maps across diverse scenes,
enabling sim-to-real transfer. Extensive experiments in both simulation and
real-world environments demonstrate that AEOS significantly improves odometry
accuracy compared to fixed-rate, optimization-only, and fully learned
baselines, while maintaining real-time performance under onboard computational
constraints. The project page can be found at

Conclusion: 该研究为动态不确定环境中的自主停车提供了一种更加高效安全的解决方案，通过预测未来停车位可用性来优化规划策略

Abstract: Accurately reasoning about future parking spot availability and integrated
planning is critical for enabling safe and efficient autonomous valet parking
in dynamic, uncertain environments. Unlike existing methods that rely solely on
instantaneous observations or static assumptions, we present an approach that
predicts future parking spot occupancy by explicitly distinguishing between
initially vacant and occupied spots, and by leveraging the predicted motion of
dynamic agents. We introduce a probabilistic spot occupancy estimator that
incorporates partial and noisy observations within a limited Field-of-View
(FoV) model and accounts for the evolving uncertainty of unobserved regions.
Coupled with this, we design a strategy planner that adaptively balances
goal-directed parking maneuvers with exploratory navigation based on
information gain, and intelligently incorporates wait-and-go behaviors at
promising spots. Through randomized simulations emulating large parking lots,
we demonstrate that our framework significantly improves parking efficiency,
safety margins, and trajectory smoothness compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Vision-based locomotion in outdoor environments presents significant
challenges for quadruped robots. Accurate environmental prediction and
effective handling of depth sensor noise during real-world deployment remain
difficult, severely restricting the outdoor applications of such algorithms. To
address these deployment challenges in vision-based motion control, this letter
proposes the Redundant Estimator Network (RENet) framework. The framework
employs a dual-estimator architecture that ensures robust motion performance
while maintaining deployment stability during onboard vision failures. Through
an online estimator adaptation, our method enables seamless transitions between
estimation modules when handling visual perception uncertainties. Experimental
validation on a real-world robot demonstrates the framework's effectiveness in
complex outdoor environments, showing particular advantages in scenarios with
degraded visual perception. This framework demonstrates its potential as a

TL;DR: OmniEVA是一个多模态大语言模型驱动的具身智能规划器，通过任务自适应的3D接地机制和具身感知推理框架，解决了现有方法在几何适应性和物理约束方面的局限性，实现了先进的具身推理和任务规划能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于MLLM的具身系统面临两个关键局限：几何适应性差距（2D输入或硬编码3D几何注入导致空间信息不足或泛化能力受限）和具身约束差距（忽略真实机器人的物理约束，导致理论上有效但实际不可行的任务规划）。

Conclusion: OmniEVA通过创新的3D接地和具身感知推理方法，有效解决了现有MLLM具身系统的关键局限，为具身智能提供了更强大和实用的规划解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have opened new
opportunities for embodied intelligence, enabling multimodal understanding,
reasoning, and interaction, as well as continuous spatial decision-making.
Nevertheless, current MLLM-based embodied systems face two critical
limitations. First, Geometric Adaptability Gap: models trained solely on 2D
inputs or with hard-coded 3D geometry injection suffer from either insufficient
spatial information or restricted 2D generalization, leading to poor
adaptability across tasks with diverse spatial demands. Second, Embodiment
Constraint Gap: prior work often neglects the physical constraints and
capacities of real robots, resulting in task plans that are theoretically valid
but practically infeasible.To address these gaps, we introduce OmniEVA -- an
embodied versatile planner that enables advanced embodied reasoning and task
planning through two pivotal innovations: (1) a Task-Adaptive 3D Grounding
mechanism, which introduces a gated router to perform explicit selective
regulation of 3D fusion based on contextual requirements, enabling
context-aware 3D grounding for diverse embodied tasks. (2) an Embodiment-Aware
Reasoning framework that jointly incorporates task goals and embodiment
constraints into the reasoning loop, resulting in planning decisions that are
both goal-directed and executable. Extensive experimental results demonstrate
that OmniEVA not only achieves state-of-the-art general embodied reasoning
performance, but also exhibits a strong ability across a wide range of
downstream scenarios. Evaluations of a suite of proposed embodied benchmarks,
including both primitive and composite tasks, confirm its robust and versatile
planning capabilities. Project page: https://omnieva.github.io

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models typically bridge the gap between
perceptual and action spaces by pre-training a large-scale Vision-Language
Model (VLM) on robotic data. While this approach greatly enhances performance,
it also incurs significant training costs. In this paper, we investigate how to
effectively bridge vision-language (VL) representations to action (A). We
introduce VLA-Adapter, a novel paradigm designed to reduce the reliance of VLA
models on large-scale VLMs and extensive pre-training. To this end, we first
systematically analyze the effectiveness of various VL conditions and present
key findings on which conditions are essential for bridging perception and
action spaces. Based on these insights, we propose a lightweight Policy module
with Bridge Attention, which autonomously injects the optimal condition into
the action space. In this way, our method achieves high performance using only
a 0.5B-parameter backbone, without any robotic data pre-training. Extensive
experiments on both simulated and real-world robotic benchmarks demonstrate
that VLA-Adapter not only achieves state-of-the-art level performance, but also
offers the fast inference speed reported to date. Furthermore, thanks to the
proposed advanced bridging paradigm, VLA-Adapter enables the training of a
powerful VLA model in just 8 hours on a single consumer-grade GPU, greatly
lowering the barrier to deploying the VLA model. Project page:

Abstract: Cable-driven continuum robots offer high flexibility and lightweight design,
making them well-suited for tasks in constrained and unstructured environments.
However, prolonged use can induce mechanical fatigue from plastic deformation
and material degradation, compromising performance and risking structural
failure. In the state of the art, fatigue estimation of continuum robots
remains underexplored, limiting long-term operation. To address this, we
propose a fatigue-aware continuum robot with three key innovations: (1) a
Hybrid Hinge-Beam structure where TwistBeam and BendBeam decouple torsion and
bending: passive revolute joints in the BendBeam mitigate stress concentration,
while TwistBeam's limited torsional deformation reduces BendBeam stress
magnitude, enhancing durability; (2) a Passive Stopper that safely constrains
motion via mechanical constraints and employs motor torque sensing to detect
corresponding limit torque, ensuring safety and enabling data collection; and
(3) a real-time fatigue-awareness method that estimates stiffness from motor
torque at the limit pose, enabling online fatigue estimation without additional
sensors. Experiments show that the proposed design reduces fatigue accumulation
by about 49% compared with a conventional design, while passive mechanical
limiting combined with motor-side sensing allows accurate estimation of
structural fatigue and damage. These results confirm the effectiveness of the
proposed architecture for safe and reliable long-term operation.

reproducible multimodal datasets. While several influential datasets have
driven progress in these domains, they often suffer from limitations in sensing
modalities, environmental diversity, and the reproducibility of the underlying
hardware setups. To address these challenges, this paper introduces SMapper, a
novel open-hardware, multi-sensor platform designed explicitly for, though not
limited to, SLAM research. The device integrates synchronized LiDAR,
multi-camera, and inertial sensing, supported by a robust calibration and
synchronization pipeline that ensures precise spatio-temporal alignment across
modalities. Its open and replicable design allows researchers to extend its
capabilities and reproduce experiments across both handheld and robot-mounted
scenarios. To demonstrate its practicality, we additionally release
SMapper-light, a publicly available SLAM dataset containing representative
indoor and outdoor sequences. The dataset includes tightly synchronized
multimodal data and ground-truth trajectories derived from offline LiDAR-based
SLAM with sub-centimeter accuracy, alongside dense 3D reconstructions.
Furthermore, the paper contains benchmarking results on state-of-the-art LiDAR
and visual SLAM frameworks using the SMapper-light dataset. By combining
open-hardware design, reproducible data collection, and comprehensive
benchmarking, SMapper establishes a robust foundation for advancing SLAM
algorithm development, evaluation, and reproducibility.

Abstract: Detecting incipient slip enables early intervention to prevent object
slippage and enhance robotic manipulation safety. However, deploying such
systems on edge platforms remains challenging, particularly due to energy
constraints. This work presents a neuromorphic tactile sensing system based on
the NeuroTac sensor with an extruding papillae-based skin and a spiking
convolutional neural network (SCNN) for slip-state classification. The SCNN
model achieves 94.33% classification accuracy across three classes (no slip,
incipient slip, and gross slip) in slip conditions induced by sensor motion.
Under the dynamic gravity-induced slip validation conditions, after temporal
smoothing of the SCNN's final-layer spike counts, the system detects incipient
slip at least 360 ms prior to gross slip across all trials, consistently
identifying incipient slip before gross slip occurs. These results demonstrate
that this neuromorphic system has stable and responsive incipient slip
detection capability.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于对象相对控制的新视觉导航方法ObjectReact，通过使用对象级别表征替代传统的图像级别表征，提高了导航系统的适配性和反向导航能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的基于图像相对控制的方法存在限制，图像表征严格绑定于机器人位式和踏迹，而对象表征作为地图属性具有更好的代理体和轨迹不变性。

Method: 提出了一种基于"相对"3D场景图的拓扑地形图表征，用于获取更信息丰富的对象级全局路径规划成本。训练了一个直接条件化在高级"WayObject Costmap"表征上的本地控制器ObjectReact，消除了显式RGB输入的需求。

Result: 在传感器高度变化和多种导航任务中，对象相对控制方法在底层空间理解能力方面显示出比图像相对方法更好的性能，包括反向导航地图轨迹。仅使用模拟器训练的策略能够艾好地渗透到真实世界室内环境。

Conclusion: 对象相对控制为单相机视觉导航提供了一种更加灵活和健壮的方法，具有更好的跨代理体部署能力和空间理解能力，为实际应用打开了新的可能性。

Abstract: Visual navigation using only a single camera and a topological map has
recently become an appealing alternative to methods that require additional
sensors and 3D maps. This is typically achieved through an "image-relative"
approach to estimating control from a given pair of current observation and
subgoal image. However, image-level representations of the world have
limitations because images are strictly tied to the agent's pose and
embodiment. In contrast, objects, being a property of the map, offer an
embodiment- and trajectory-invariant world representation. In this work, we
present a new paradigm of learning "object-relative" control that exhibits
several desirable characteristics: a) new routes can be traversed without
strictly requiring to imitate prior experience, b) the control prediction
problem can be decoupled from solving the image matching problem, and c) high
invariance can be achieved in cross-embodiment deployment for variations across
both training-testing and mapping-execution settings. We propose a topometric
map representation in the form of a "relative" 3D scene graph, which is used to
obtain more informative object-level global path planning costs. We train a
local controller, dubbed "ObjectReact", conditioned directly on a high-level
"WayObject Costmap" representation that eliminates the need for an explicit RGB
input. We demonstrate the advantages of learning object-relative control over
its image-relative counterpart across sensor height variations and multiple
navigation tasks that challenge the underlying spatial understanding
capability, e.g., navigating a map trajectory in the reverse direction. We
further show that our sim-only policy is able to generalize well to real-world
indoor environments. Code and supplementary material are accessible via project

TL;DR: 开发了能够全身膨胀收缩的机器人MOFU，研究发现膨胀收缩运动能显著增强机器人被感知的生命感，是未来机器人设计中的重要元素


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有治疗和社交机器人主要模仿外观和关节运动，但忽视了生物体中观察到的全身膨胀收缩这种体积变化运动对生命感感知的影响

Method: 开发了MOFU机器人，采用Jitterbug结构实现单电机驱动的全身膨胀收缩，并通过在线视频调查使用Godspeed问卷评估膨胀收缩运动对生命感感知的影响

Result: 膨胀收缩运动显著提高了感知生命感；两个机器人相比单个机器人并未显著增加生命感；膨胀收缩与运动结合比单独运动获得更高的生命感评分

Conclusion: 体积变化运动如膨胀收缩能增强机器人的感知生命感，应在未来旨在塑造人类印象的机器人开发中作为重要设计元素考虑

Abstract: Robots for therapy and social interaction are often intended to evoke
"animacy" in humans. While many robots imitate appearance and joint movements,
little attention has been given to whole-body expansion-contraction,
volume-changing movements observed in living organisms, and their effect on
animacy perception. We developed a mobile robot called "MOFU (Morphing Fluffy
Unit)," capable of whole-body expansion-contraction with a single motor and
covered with a fluffy exterior. MOFU employs a "Jitterbug" structure, a
geometric transformation mechanism that enables smooth volume change in
diameter from 210 to 280 mm using one actuator. It is also equipped with a
differential two-wheel drive mechanism for locomotion. To evaluate the effect
of expansion-contraction movements, we conducted an online survey using videos
of MOFU's behavior. Participants rated impressions with the Godspeed
Questionnaire Series. First, we compared videos of MOFU in a stationary state
with and without expansion-contraction and turning, finding that
expansion-contraction significantly increased perceived animacy. Second, we
hypothesized that presenting two MOFUs would increase animacy compared with a
single robot; however, this was not supported, as no significant difference
emerged. Exploratory analyses further compared four dual-robot motion
conditions. Third, when expansion-contraction was combined with locomotion,
animacy ratings were higher than locomotion alone. These results suggest that
volume-changing movements such as expansion and contraction enhance perceived
animacy in robots and should be considered an important design element in
future robot development aimed at shaping human impressions.

TL;DR: Dexplore是一个统一单循环优化框架，直接从大规模手-物体运动捕捉数据学习机器人控制策略，避免了传统三阶段方法的问题，并通过强化学习保持策略在自适应空间范围内完成任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有手-物体运动捕捉数据存在不准确性和人-机器人手之间的具身差距，传统三阶段方法（重定向、跟踪、残差校正）导致演示数据利用不足和误差累积。

Method: 提出统一单循环优化，联合执行重定向和跟踪，将演示作为软指导而非绝对真值。从原始轨迹推导自适应空间范围，使用强化学习训练策略保持在范围内同时最小化控制努力并完成任务。

Result: 统一框架保留了演示意图，使机器人特定策略涌现，提高对噪声的鲁棒性，并能扩展到大规模演示语料库。最终将跟踪策略蒸馏为基于视觉的技能条件生成控制器。

Conclusion: Dexplore提供了一个原则性桥梁，将不完美的演示转化为灵巧操作的有效训练信号，支持跨物体泛化和真实世界部署。

Abstract: Hand-object motion-capture (MoCap) repositories offer large-scale,
contact-rich demonstrations and hold promise for scaling dexterous robotic
manipulation. Yet demonstration inaccuracies and embodiment gaps between human
and robot hands limit the straightforward use of these data. Existing methods
adopt a three-stage workflow, including retargeting, tracking, and residual
correction, which often leaves demonstrations underused and compound errors
across stages. We introduce Dexplore, a unified single-loop optimization that
jointly performs retargeting and tracking to learn robot control policies
directly from MoCap at scale. Rather than treating demonstrations as ground
truth, we use them as soft guidance. From raw trajectories, we derive adaptive
spatial scopes, and train with reinforcement learning to keep the policy
in-scope while minimizing control effort and accomplishing the task. This
unified formulation preserves demonstration intent, enables robot-specific
strategies to emerge, improves robustness to noise, and scales to large
demonstration corpora. We distill the scaled tracking policy into a
vision-based, skill-conditioned generative controller that encodes diverse
manipulation skills in a rich latent representation, supporting generalization
across objects and real-world deployment. Taken together, these contributions
position Dexplore as a principled bridge that transforms imperfect
demonstrations into effective training signals for dexterous manipulation.

Motivation: 解决VLA模型面临的两大挑战：大规模人工操控轨迹数据的稀缺和高成本，以及在分布偏移任务中的局限性

Method: 基于veRL构建SimpleVLA-RL框架，包含VLA特定轨迹采样、可扩展并行化、多环境渲染和优化损失计算，并引入探索增强策略

Conclusion: RL能够有效提升VLA模型的长期限行动规划能力，减少对大规模数据的依赖，并实现更好的演化性能

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently emerged as a powerful
paradigm for robotic manipulation. Despite substantial progress enabled by
large-scale pretraining and supervised fine-tuning (SFT), these models face two
fundamental challenges: (i) the scarcity and high cost of large-scale
human-operated robotic trajectories required for SFT scaling, and (ii) limited
generalization to tasks involving distribution shift. Recent breakthroughs in
Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) demonstrate that reinforcement learning (RL) can
dramatically enhance step-by-step reasoning capabilities, raising a natural
question: Can RL similarly improve the long-horizon step-by-step action
planning of VLA? In this work, we introduce SimpleVLA-RL, an efficient RL
framework tailored for VLA models. Building upon veRL, we introduce
VLA-specific trajectory sampling, scalable parallelization, multi-environment
rendering, and optimized loss computation. When applied to OpenVLA-OFT,
SimpleVLA-RL achieves SoTA performance on LIBERO and even outperforms $\pi_0$
on RoboTwin 1.0\&2.0 with the exploration-enhancing strategies we introduce.
SimpleVLA-RL not only reduces dependence on large-scale data and enables robust
generalization, but also remarkably surpasses SFT in real-world tasks.
Moreover, we identify a novel phenomenon ``pushcut'' during RL training,
wherein the policy discovers previously unseen patterns beyond those seen in
the previous training process. Github: https://github.com/PRIME-RL/SimpleVLA-RL

Motivation: 在高风险应用中，需要准确评估神经网络对每个样本的不确定性量化。传统方法使用贝叶斯或近似模型的预测分布，将预测不确定性分解为认知不确定性和偶然不确定性，但这种加法分解方法最近受到质疑。

Method: 提出基于不同模型预测中类别概率分布信噪比的直观框架，引入方差门控度量，通过集成模型推导置信因子来缩放预测。

Result: 开发了新的不确定性估计和分解方法，能够更有效地量化预测不确定性，并揭示了委员会机器可能存在多样性崩溃的现象。

Conclusion: 该框架为不确定性量化提供了新的视角，通过信噪比分析和方差门控机制改进了传统的不确定性分解方法，对高风险决策应用具有重要意义。

Abstract: Evaluation of per-sample uncertainty quantification from neural networks is
essential for decision-making involving high-risk applications. A common
approach is to use the predictive distribution from Bayesian or approximation
models and decompose the corresponding predictive uncertainty into epistemic
(model-related) and aleatoric (data-related) components. However, additive
decomposition has recently been questioned. In this work, we propose an
intuitive framework for uncertainty estimation and decomposition based on the
signal-to-noise ratio of class probability distributions across different model
predictions. We introduce a variance-gated measure that scales predictions by a
confidence factor derived from ensembles. We use this measure to discuss the
existence of a collapse in the diversity of committee machines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准MMWU算法在矩阵LEA问题上只能达到最小最大最优遗憾界，但无法实现实例最优性能。本文旨在开发一个既能保持计算效率又能获得更好遗憾界的改进算法。

Method: 开发了一个通用的基于势能的矩阵LEA框架，通过新的"单边"Jensen迹不等式和拉普拉斯变换技术，应用超越指数函数的广义势函数，最终由虚误差函数导出的最优势函数产生新算法。

Result: 新算法实现了O(√(T·S(X||d⁻¹I_d)))的实例最优遗憾界，计算复杂度与MMWU相同，在量子态学习、去极化噪声、随机量子态和Gibbs态学习等应用中优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该工作提供了在保持计算效率的同时实现实例最优性能的矩阵学习算法，在量子学习理论中具有重要应用价值，能够有效预测非线性量子特性。

Abstract: The Matrix Multiplicative Weight Update (MMWU) is a seminal online learning
algorithm with numerous applications. Applied to the matrix version of the
Learning from Expert Advice (LEA) problem on the $d$-dimensional spectraplex,
it is well known that MMWU achieves the minimax-optimal regret bound of
$O(\sqrt{T\log d})$, where $T$ is the time horizon. In this paper, we present
an improved algorithm achieving the instance-optimal regret bound of
$O(\sqrt{T\cdot S(X||d^{-1}I_d)})$, where $X$ is the comparator in the regret,
$I_d$ is the identity matrix, and $S(\cdot||\cdot)$ denotes the quantum
relative entropy. Furthermore, our algorithm has the same computational
complexity as MMWU, indicating that the improvement in the regret bound is
``free''.
  Technically, we first develop a general potential-based framework for matrix
LEA, with MMWU being its special case induced by the standard exponential
potential. Then, the crux of our analysis is a new ``one-sided'' Jensen's trace
inequality built on a Laplace transform technique, which allows the application
of general potential functions beyond exponential to matrix LEA. Our algorithm
is finally induced by an optimal potential function from the vector LEA
problem, based on the imaginary error function.
  Complementing the above, we provide a memory lower bound for matrix LEA, and
explore the applications of our algorithm in quantum learning theory. We show
that it outperforms the state of the art for learning quantum states corrupted
by depolarization noise, random quantum states, and Gibbs states. In addition,
applying our algorithm to linearized convex losses enables predicting nonlinear
quantum properties, such as purity, quantum virtual cooling, and R\'{e}nyi-$2$
correlation.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对对抗性奖励腐败的鲁棒Q学习算法，在异步采样模型下实现了与无对抗情况相近的有限时间收敛率，并建立了信息理论下界证明其最优性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习算法在面对奖励信号受到对抗性腐败（如极端噪声、传感器故障或恶意攻击）时性能会严重下降，需要开发能够有效处理此类腐败的鲁棒算法。

Method: 提出了新的可证明鲁棒的Q学习变体算法，包括需要知道真实奖励分布统计信息的版本和无需此先验知识的版本。后者利用了改进的Azuma-Hoeffding不等式来处理几乎鞅的技术工具。

Result: 在异步采样模型下，即使存在对抗性腐败，算法的有限时间收敛率与非对抗情况相匹配，仅增加一个与腐败样本比例成正比的附加项。信息理论下界证明了这个附加项是不可避免的。

Conclusion: 这项工作首次为异步Q学习提供了有限时间鲁棒性保证，填补了鲁棒强化学习领域的重要空白，所提出的技术工具可能具有独立的研究价值。

Abstract: We consider the problem of learning the optimal policy in a discounted,
infinite-horizon reinforcement learning (RL) setting where the reward signal is
subject to adversarial corruption. Such corruption, which may arise from
extreme noise, sensor faults, or malicious attacks, can severely degrade the
performance of classical algorithms such as Q-learning. To address this
challenge, we propose a new provably robust variant of the Q-learning algorithm
that operates effectively even when a fraction of the observed rewards are
arbitrarily perturbed by an adversary. Under the asynchronous sampling model
with time-correlated data, we establish that despite adversarial corruption,
the finite-time convergence rate of our algorithm matches that of existing
results for the non-adversarial case, up to an additive term proportional to
the fraction of corrupted samples. Moreover, we derive an information-theoretic
lower bound revealing that the additive corruption term in our upper bounds is
unavoidable.
  Next, we propose a variant of our algorithm that requires no prior knowledge
of the statistics of the true reward distributions. The analysis of this
setting is particularly challenging and is enabled by carefully exploiting a
refined Azuma-Hoeffding inequality for almost-martingales, a technical tool
that might be of independent interest. Collectively, our contributions provide
the first finite-time robustness guarantees for asynchronous Q-learning,
bridging a significant gap in robust RL.

Motivation: 传统ML方法在多源异构数据中容易学习虚假相关性，在非典型或代表性不足群体上性能下降。现有最差群体优化方法假设群体分布可准确估计，但在噪声、非平稳和动态环境中这一假设常被违反

Result: 提供了算法收敛性理论结果，并在真实世界数据上验证了方法的有效性

Conclusion: 提出的Wasserstein DRO框架能够有效处理群体分布不确定性，在噪声和非平稳环境中提升最差群体性能

Abstract: The performance of machine learning (ML) models critically depends on the
quality and representativeness of the training data. In applications with
multiple heterogeneous data generating sources, standard ML methods often learn
spurious correlations that perform well on average but degrade performance for
atypical or underrepresented groups. Prior work addresses this issue by
optimizing the worst-group performance. However, these approaches typically
assume that the underlying data distributions for each group can be accurately
estimated using the training data, a condition that is frequently violated in
noisy, non-stationary, and evolving environments. In this work, we propose a
novel framework that relies on Wasserstein-based distributionally robust
optimization (DRO) to account for the distributional uncertainty within each
group, while simultaneously preserving the objective of improving the
worst-group performance. We develop a gradient descent-ascent algorithm to
solve the proposed DRO problem and provide convergence results. Finally, we
validate the effectiveness of our method on real-world data.

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain a leading cause of mortality worldwide,
underscoring the importance of accurate and scalable diagnostic systems.
Electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis is central to detecting cardiac abnormalities,
yet challenges such as noise, class imbalance, and dataset heterogeneity limit
current methods. To address these issues, we propose FoundationalECGNet, a
foundational framework for automated ECG classification. The model integrates a
dual-stage denoising by Morlet and Daubechies wavelets transformation,
Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM), Graph Attention Networks (GAT),
and Time Series Transformers (TST) to jointly capture spatial and temporal
dependencies in multi-channel ECG signals. FoundationalECGNet first
distinguishes between Normal and Abnormal ECG signals, and then classifies the
Abnormal signals into one of five cardiac conditions: Arrhythmias, Conduction
Disorders, Myocardial Infarction, QT Abnormalities, or Hypertrophy. Across
multiple datasets, the model achieves a 99% F1-score for Normal vs. Abnormal
classification and shows state-of-the-art performance in multi-class disease
detection, including a 99% F1-score for Conduction Disorders and Hypertrophy,
as well as a 98.9% F1-score for Arrhythmias. Additionally, the model provides
risk level estimations to facilitate clinical decision-making. In conclusion,
FoundationalECGNet represents a scalable, interpretable, and generalizable
solution for automated ECG analysis, with the potential to improve diagnostic
precision and patient outcomes in healthcare settings. We'll share the code
after acceptance.

Result: 发现LRP-beta的常数与权重范数无关，这与基于梯度的方法和LRP-epsilon形成显著区别。

Conclusion: 该分析对多非几何数据增强场景和Smoothgrad型归因方法具有重要意义，揭示了LRP-beta在权重范数独立性方面的独特优势。

Abstract: We analyze numerical properties of Layer-wise relevance propagation
(LRP)-type attribution methods by representing them as a product of modified
gradient matrices. This representation creates an analogy to matrix
multiplications of Jacobi-matrices which arise from the chain rule of
differentiation. In order to shed light on the distribution of attribution
values, we derive upper bounds for singular values. Furthermore we derive
component-wise bounds for attribution map values. As a main result, we apply
these component-wise bounds to obtain multiplicative constants. These constants
govern the convergence of empirical means of attributions to expectations of
attribution maps. This finding has important implications for scenarios where
multiple non-geometric data augmentations are applied to individual test
samples, as well as for Smoothgrad-type attribution methods. In particular, our
analysis reveals that the constants for LRP-beta remain independent of weight
norms, a significant distinction from both gradient-based methods and
LRP-epsilon.

Conclusion: 碳感知的客户端选择和训练调度能有效减少联邦学习的碳排放，同时保持模型性能，为绿色机器学习提供了可行方案

Abstract: Training large-scale machine learning models incurs substantial carbon
emissions. Federated Learning (FL), by distributing computation across
geographically dispersed clients, offers a natural framework to leverage
regional and temporal variations in Carbon Intensity (CI). This paper
investigates how to reduce emissions in FL through carbon-aware client
selection and training scheduling. We first quantify the emission savings of a
carbon-aware scheduling policy that leverages slack time -- permitting a modest
extension of the training duration so that clients can defer local training
rounds to lower-carbon periods. We then examine the performance trade-offs of
such scheduling which stem from statistical heterogeneity among clients,
selection bias in participation, and temporal correlation in model updates. To
leverage these trade-offs, we construct a carbon-aware scheduler that
integrates slack time, $\alpha$-fair carbon allocation, and a global
fine-tuning phase. Experiments on real-world CI data show that our scheduler
outperforms slack-agnostic baselines, achieving higher model accuracy across a
wide range of carbon budgets, with especially strong gains under tight carbon
constraints.

PyePAL uses Gaussian process models to predict objective values (hardness and
elasticity) from the design variables (spin speed, dilution, and polymer
mixture), guiding the adaptive selection of samples toward promising regions of
the design space. To enable interpretable insights into the high-dimensional
design space, we utilize UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection)
for two-dimensional visualization of the Pareto front exploration.
Additionally, we incorporate fuzzy linguistic summaries, which translate the
learned relationships between process parameters and performance objectives
into linguistic statements, thus enhancing the explainability and understanding
of the optimization results. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
efficiently identifies promising polymer designs, while the visual and
linguistic explanations facilitate expert-driven analysis and knowledge
discovery.

TL;DR: ANNA是一种高效的注意力机制，具有亚二次时间复杂度，能够保持标准注意力的表达能力，同时解决关键推理任务并模拟低秩变换器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 变换器具有模拟大规模并行计算算法的表示能力，但二次时间复杂度严重限制了其可扩展性，需要开发更高效的注意力机制。

Method: 引入近似最近邻注意力机制(ANNA)，具有亚二次时间复杂度，通过MPC框架证明其表达能力，并分析其在关键推理任务中的性能。

Result: ANNA变换器保持标准注意力的表达能力，能够解决Match2和k-hop等关键推理任务，且常数深度ANNA变换器可以模拟常数深度低秩变换器。

Conclusion: ANNA提供了一种统一的方式来推理广泛的注意力近似方法，在保持表达能力的同时显著提高了计算效率。

Abstract: Transformers have the representational capacity to simulate Massively
Parallel Computation (MPC) algorithms, but they suffer from quadratic time
complexity, which severely limits their scalability. We introduce an efficient
attention mechanism called Approximate Nearest Neighbor Attention (ANNA) with
sub-quadratic time complexity. We prove that ANNA-transformers (1) retain the
expressive power previously established for standard attention in terms of
matching the capabilities of MPC algorithms, and (2) can solve key reasoning
tasks such as Match2 and $k$-hop with near-optimal depth. Using the MPC
framework, we further prove that constant-depth ANNA-transformers can simulate
constant-depth low-rank transformers, thereby providing a unified way to reason
about a broad class of efficient attention approximations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无监督异常检测在该领域面临挑战，实际表格数据常包含异质上下文，单一全局分布容易忽略上下文细节，影响检测性能。

Method: 提出上下文条件异常检测框架，自动识别上下文特征并使用简单深度自动编码器建模条件数据分布。

Result: 在多个表格标准数据集上进行广泛实验，方法表现超过最先进方法。

Conclusion: 上下文在准确区分异常与正常实例中具有重要作用，证明了条件化检测框架的有效性。

Abstract: Anomaly detection is critical in domains such as cybersecurity and finance,
especially when working with large-scale tabular data. Yet, unsupervised
anomaly detection -- where no labeled anomalies are available -- remains a
significant challenge. Although various deep learning methods have been
proposed to model a dataset's joint distribution, real-world tabular data often
contain heterogeneous contexts (e.g., different users), making globally rare
events normal under certain contexts. Consequently, relying on a single global
distribution can overlook these contextual nuances, degrading detection
performance. In this paper, we present a context-conditional anomaly detection
framework tailored for tabular datasets. Our approach automatically identifies
context features and models the conditional data distribution using a simple
deep autoencoder. Extensive experiments on multiple tabular benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches,
underscoring the importance of context in accurately distinguishing anomalous
from normal instances.

Motivation: 数据驱动气象模型进展平台化，需要新方法突破现有限制，而非重新建立新的预报器

Method: 使用混合专家模型(MoWE)方法，通过Vision Transformer基础的间控网络动态学习多个专家模型在每个格点的权重分配，考虑预报时效

Result: 在2天预报时效上，模型达到比最佳AI气象模型较低10%的均方根误差(RMSE)，显著超过单个专家模型和简单平均法

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种计算效率高、可扩展的策略，能够充分利用现有高质量预报模型来推动数据驱动气象预报的最新技术水平

Abstract: Data-driven weather models have recently achieved state-of-the-art
performance, yet progress has plateaued in recent years. This paper introduces
a Mixture of Experts (MoWE) approach as a novel paradigm to overcome these
limitations, not by creating a new forecaster, but by optimally combining the
outputs of existing models. The MoWE model is trained with significantly lower
computational resources than the individual experts. Our model employs a Vision
Transformer-based gating network that dynamically learns to weight the
contributions of multiple "expert" models at each grid point, conditioned on
forecast lead time. This approach creates a synthesized deterministic forecast
that is more accurate than any individual component in terms of Root Mean
Squared Error (RMSE). Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of this method,
achieving up to a 10% lower RMSE than the best-performing AI weather model on a
2-day forecast horizon, significantly outperforming individual experts as well
as a simple average across experts. This work presents a computationally
efficient and scalable strategy to push the state of the art in data-driven
weather prediction by making the most out of leading high-quality forecast
models.

Motivation: 可再生能源和分布式能源的集成改变了现代电力系统，对传统保护方案构成挑战，需要研究机器学习在电力系统保护和扰动管理中的应用现状和发展方向。

Method: 采用PRISMA范围综述框架，基于100多篇文献进行综合分析，建立了ML导向的保护任务分类法，解决了术语不一致问题，并提出了标准化报告实践指南。

Result: ML模型在仿真数据集上通常表现出高精度，但在真实条件下的性能验证不足；现有文献存在方法严谨性、数据集质量和评估指标不一致的问题；缺乏标准化阻碍了结果的可比性和发现的可推广性。

Conclusion: 需要优先开发公共基准数据集、现实验证方法和先进ML架构，推动基于ML的保护从理论承诺走向在日益动态和分散的电力系统中的实际部署。

Abstract: The integration of renewable and distributed energy resources reshapes modern
power systems, challenging conventional protection schemes. This scoping review
synthesizes recent literature on machine learning (ML) applications in power
system protection and disturbance management, following the PRISMA for Scoping
Reviews framework. Based on over 100 publications, three key objectives are
addressed: (i) assessing the scope of ML research in protection tasks; (ii)
evaluating ML performance across diverse operational scenarios; and (iii)
identifying methods suitable for evolving grid conditions. ML models often
demonstrate high accuracy on simulated datasets; however, their performance
under real-world conditions remains insufficiently validated. The existing
literature is fragmented, with inconsistencies in methodological rigor, dataset
quality, and evaluation metrics. This lack of standardization hampers the
comparability of results and limits the generalizability of findings. To
address these challenges, this review introduces a ML-oriented taxonomy for
protection tasks, resolves key terminological inconsistencies, and advocates
for standardized reporting practices. It further provides guidelines for
comprehensive dataset documentation, methodological transparency, and
consistent evaluation protocols, aiming to improve reproducibility and enhance
the practical relevance of research outcomes. Critical gaps remain, including
the scarcity of real-world validation, insufficient robustness testing, and
limited consideration of deployment feasibility. Future research should
prioritize public benchmark datasets, realistic validation methods, and
advanced ML architectures. These steps are essential to move ML-based
protection from theoretical promise to practical deployment in increasingly
dynamic and decentralized power systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: STRIDE是一个可扩展的XAI框架，通过RKHS中的正交函数分解避免特征子集枚举，提供功能组件而非单一标量归因，在表格数据上实现3倍加速和高保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有XAI框架的两个主要限制：特征子集枚举的指数级计算成本和将效应总结为单一标量值的表达能力不足问题。

Method: 基于再生核希尔伯特空间(RKHS)的正交函数分解方法，通过递归核中心化程序的分析投影方案计算功能组件f_S(x_S)，避免显式子集枚举。

Result: 在10个数据集上实现中位数约3倍的加速(0.6-9.7倍范围)，保持高保真度(R^2在0.81-0.999之间)，并在大多数数据集上具有显著的排序一致性。

Conclusion: STRIDE通过提供结构化功能视角补充了标量归因方法，支持新颖的诊断功能如'组件手术'来量化特定交互作用的影响。

Abstract: Most explainable AI (XAI) frameworks face two practical limitations: the
exponential cost of reasoning over feature subsets and the reduced
expressiveness of summarizing effects as single scalar values. We present
STRIDE, a scalable framework that aims to mitigate both issues by framing
explanation as a subset-enumeration-free, orthogonal functional decomposition
in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). Rather than focusing only on
scalar attributions, STRIDE computes functional components f_S(x_S) via an
analytical projection scheme based on a recursive kernel-centering procedure,
avoiding explicit subset enumeration. In the tabular setups we study, the
approach is model-agnostic, provides both local and global views, and is
supported by theoretical results on orthogonality and L^2 convergence under
stated assumptions. On public tabular benchmarks in our environment, we
observed speedups ranging from 0.6 times (slower than TreeSHAP on a small
dataset) to 9.7 times (California), with a median approximate 3.0 times across
10 datasets, while maintaining high fidelity (R^2 between 0.81 and 0.999) and
substantial rank agreement on most datasets. Overall, STRIDE complements scalar
attribution methods by offering a structured functional perspective, enabling
novel diagnostics like 'component surgery' to quantitatively measure the impact
of specific interactions within our experimental scope.

Motivation: 解决机器学习中模型选择和演继性问题，利用Rashomon效应中多个高性能模型并存的特点来提升演继能力

Method: 通过模型性能和解释进行分组，构建多样性最大化的集成，保持预测准确性的同时每个模型覆盖解决方案空间的不同区域

Result: 在开放和专有协作数据集上验证，在Rashomon比率较大的场景下实现了超过0.20+ AUROC的提升，并在多个实际应用中展现出稳健性和实用性

Conclusion: Rashomon集成方法通过统筹选择多样性高性能模型，有效提高了模型的演继性能和稳健性，在实际应用中具有重要价值

Abstract: Creating models from past observations and ensuring their effectiveness on
new data is the essence of machine learning. However, selecting models that
generalize well remains a challenging task. Related to this topic, the Rashomon
Effect refers to cases where multiple models perform similarly well for a given
learning problem. This often occurs in real-world scenarios, like the
manufacturing process or medical diagnosis, where diverse patterns in data lead
to multiple high-performing solutions. We propose the Rashomon Ensemble, a
method that strategically selects models from these diverse high-performing
solutions to improve generalization. By grouping models based on both their
performance and explanations, we construct ensembles that maximize diversity
while maintaining predictive accuracy. This selection ensures that each model
covers a distinct region of the solution space, making the ensemble more robust
to distribution shifts and variations in unseen data. We validate our approach
on both open and proprietary collaborative real-world datasets, demonstrating
up to 0.20+ AUROC improvements in scenarios where the Rashomon ratio is large.
Additionally, we demonstrate tangible benefits for businesses in various
real-world applications, highlighting the robustness, practicality, and
effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: We study the Riemannian geometry of the Deep Linear Network (DLN) as a
foundation for a thermodynamic description of the learning process. The main
tools are the use of group actions to analyze overparametrization and the use
of Riemannian submersion from the space of parameters to the space of
observables. The foliation of the balanced manifold in the parameter space by
group orbits is used to define and compute a Boltzmann entropy. We also show
that the Riemannian geometry on the space of observables defined in [2] is
obtained by Riemannian submersion of the balanced manifold. The main technical
step is an explicit construction of an orthonormal basis for the tangent space
of the balanced manifold using the theory of Jacobi matrices.

Motivation: 传统LoRA方法对所有增量矩阵使用统一的秩分配，而现有的秩分配技术计算效率低、复杂且不稳定，限制了在实际应用中的效果。

Method: 提出Sensitivity-LoRA方法，利用损失函数的二阶导数（Hessian矩阵）来捕捉权重敏感度，基于全局和局部敏感度动态分配秩，实现最优秩分配且计算开销最小。

Result: 实验结果表明，Sensitivity-LoRA在多种任务和基准测试中表现出强大的有效性、效率和稳定性。

Conclusion: Sensitivity-LoRA通过动态秩分配解决了LoRA方法的局限性，为资源受限环境下的LLM专业化微调提供了高效稳定的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed both everyday life and
scientific research. However, adapting LLMs from general-purpose models to
specialized tasks remains challenging, particularly in resource-constrained
environments. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), a prominent method within
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), has emerged as a promising approach to
LLMs by approximating model weight updates using low-rank decomposition.
However, LoRA is limited by its uniform rank ( r ) allocation to each
incremental matrix, and existing rank allocation techniques aimed at addressing
this issue remain computationally inefficient, complex, and unstable, hindering
practical applications. To address these limitations, we propose
Sensitivity-LoRA, an efficient fine-tuning method that dynamically allocates
ranks to weight matrices based on both their global and local sensitivities. It
leverages the second-order derivatives (Hessian Matrix) of the loss function to
effectively capture weight sensitivity, enabling optimal rank allocation with
minimal computational overhead. Our experimental results have demonstrated
robust effectiveness, efficiency and stability of Sensitivity-LoRA across
diverse tasks and benchmarks.

Conclusion: 该因果性深度学习框架不仅在北极海冰预测中表现优异，还可扩展到其他动态高维预测领域，为因果性预测模型提供了可扩展的理论基础和实践性能

Abstract: Conventional machine learning and deep learning models typically rely on
correlation-based learning, which often fails to distinguish genuine causal
relationships from spurious associations, limiting their robustness,
interpretability, and ability to generalize. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce a causality-aware deep learning framework that integrates
Multivariate Granger Causality (MVGC) and PCMCI+ for causal feature selection
within a hybrid neural architecture. Leveraging 43 years (1979-2021) of Arctic
Sea Ice Extent (SIE) data and associated ocean-atmospheric variables at daily
and monthly resolutions, the proposed method identifies causally influential
predictors, prioritizes direct causes of SIE dynamics, reduces unnecessary
features, and enhances computational efficiency. Experimental results show that
incorporating causal inputs leads to improved prediction accuracy and
interpretability across varying lead times. While demonstrated on Arctic SIE
forecasting, the framework is broadly applicable to other dynamic,
high-dimensional domains, offering a scalable approach that advances both the
theoretical foundations and practical performance of causality-informed
predictive modeling.

Method: 使用PINN来近似HJB基于价值函数，通过价值梯度迭代(VGI)模块迭代精炼沿轨迹的价值梯度，确保价值学习与价值梯度学习对齐

Result: 在连续时间版本的多机器粒子环境(MPE)和多机器MuJoCo标准测试中，方法持续超越现有连续时间RL基线，并能扩展到复杂多机器动力学系统

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了连续时间多机器强化学习的关键挑战，通过提高梯度准确性来获得更准确的价值估计和更强的策略学习能力

Abstract: Existing reinforcement learning (RL) methods struggle with complex dynamical
systems that demand interactions at high frequencies or irregular time
intervals. Continuous-time RL (CTRL) has emerged as a promising alternative by
replacing discrete-time Bellman recursion with differential value functions
defined as viscosity solutions of the Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman (HJB) equation.
While CTRL has shown promise, its applications have been largely limited to the
single-agent domain. This limitation stems from two key challenges: (i)
conventional solution methods for HJB equations suffer from the curse of
dimensionality (CoD), making them intractable in high-dimensional systems; and
(ii) even with HJB-based learning approaches, accurately approximating
centralized value functions in multi-agent settings remains difficult, which in
turn destabilizes policy training. In this paper, we propose a CT-MARL
framework that uses physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to approximate
HJB-based value functions at scale. To ensure the value is consistent with its
differential structure, we align value learning with value-gradient learning by
introducing a Value Gradient Iteration (VGI) module that iteratively refines
value gradients along trajectories. This improves gradient fidelity, in turn
yielding more accurate values and stronger policy learning. We evaluate our
method using continuous-time variants of standard benchmarks, including
multi-agent particle environment (MPE) and multi-agent MuJoCo. Our results
demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing continuous-time
RL baselines and scales to complex multi-agent dynamics.

Result: XGBoost树基模型表现最佳，预测准确率达98%，并且对时间、空间和数据缺失具有良好的强锐性

Conclusion: 该方法可以帮助ISP完全自动化对等互联伙伴选择过程，推动更高效优化的互联网生态系统

Abstract: Internet service providers (ISPs) need to connect with other ISPs to provide
global connectivity services to their users. To ensure global connectivity,
ISPs can either use transit service(s) or establish direct peering
relationships between themselves via Internet exchange points (IXPs). Peering
offers more room for ISP-specific optimizations and is preferred, but it often
involves a lengthy and complex process. Automating peering partner selection
can enhance efficiency in the global Internet ecosystem. We explore the use of
publicly available data on ISPs to develop a machine learning (ML) model that
can predict whether an ISP pair should peer or not. At first, we explore public
databases, e.g., PeeringDB, CAIDA, etc., to gather data on ISPs. Then, we
evaluate the performance of three broad types of ML models for predicting
peering relationships: tree-based, neural network-based, and transformer-based.
Among these, we observe that tree-based models achieve the highest accuracy and
efficiency in our experiments. The XGBoost model trained with publicly
available data showed promising performance, with a 98% accuracy rate in
predicting peering partners. In addition, the model demonstrated great
resilience to variations in time, space, and missing data. We envision that
ISPs can adopt our method to fully automate the peering partner selection
process, thus transitioning to a more efficient and optimized Internet
ecosystem.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然零样本语音克隆和文本转语音技术发展快速，但西班牙语语音审计领域仍然缺乏相关研究，而西班牙语是全球超过600万人使用的语言。

Method: 构建HISPASpoof数据集，包含来自516种口音的真实语音和使用6种零样本TTS系统生成的合成语音，并评估五种代表性检测方法的性能。

Result: 在英语上训练的检测器在西班牙语上无法良好通用，而使用HISPASpoof进行训练能够显著提高检测性能，同时在合成语音归因任务上也取得了评估结果。

Conclusion: HISPASpoof为推进西班牙语语音审计领域的可靠性和包容性提供了重要的基准，补充了该语言在语音安全检测方面的空白。

Abstract: Zero-shot Voice Cloning (VC) and Text-to-Speech (TTS) methods have advanced
rapidly, enabling the generation of highly realistic synthetic speech and
raising serious concerns about their misuse. While numerous detectors have been
developed for English and Chinese, Spanish-spoken by over 600 million people
worldwide-remains underrepresented in speech forensics. To address this gap, we
introduce HISPASpoof, the first large-scale Spanish dataset designed for
synthetic speech detection and attribution. It includes real speech from public
corpora across six accents and synthetic speech generated with six zero-shot
TTS systems. We evaluate five representative methods, showing that detectors
trained on English fail to generalize to Spanish, while training on HISPASpoof
substantially improves detection. We also evaluate synthetic speech attribution
performance on HISPASpoof, i.e., identifying the generation method of synthetic
speech. HISPASpoof thus provides a critical benchmark for advancing reliable
and inclusive speech forensics in Spanish.

Abstract: Large-scale transformer models have emerged as a powerful tool for semantic
communication systems, enabling edge devices to extract rich representations
for robust inference across noisy wireless channels. However, their substantial
computational demands remain a major barrier to practical deployment in
resource-constrained 6G networks. In this paper, we present a training-free
framework for adaptive token merging in pretrained vision transformers to
jointly reduce inference time and transmission resource usage. We formulate the
selection of per-layer merging proportions as a multi-objective optimization
problem to balance accuracy and computational cost. We employ Gaussian
process-based Bayesian optimization to construct a Pareto frontier of optimal
configurations, enabling flexible runtime adaptation to dynamic application
requirements and channel conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms other baselines and achieves significant
reductions in floating-point operations while maintaining competitive accuracy
across a wide range of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. Additional
results highlight the effectiveness of adaptive policies that adjust merging
aggressiveness in response to channel quality, providing a practical mechanism
to trade off latency and semantic fidelity on demand. These findings establish
a scalable and efficient approach for deploying transformer-based semantic
communication in future edge intelligence systems.

*Hanyi Mao,Quanjia Xiao,Lei Pang,Haixiao Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FSPO是一种序列级强化学习方法，通过在重要性采样权重空间中实施长度公平的裁剪来解决PPO/GRPO方法在序列长度上的不公平问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有序列级RL方法在移植PPO/GRPO式裁剪时存在固定裁剪范围系统性地重加权短响应与长响应的问题，导致有效目标失真。

Method: 提出FSPO方法，在序列对数IS比率上应用高斯启发的裁剪带，包含KL校正漂移项并按√L缩放，确保长度公平性。

Result: FSPO在不同长度区间上平坦化裁剪率，稳定训练过程，并在多个评估数据集上优于所有基线方法。

Conclusion: FSPO通过理论形式化的长度公平性保证，有效解决了序列级RL中的长度偏差问题，提供了更稳定和公平的训练方法。

Abstract: We propose FSPO (Fair Sequence Policy Optimization), a sequence-level
reinforcement learning method for LLMs that enforces length-fair clipping
directly in the importance-sampling (IS) weight space. We revisit
sequence-level RL methods and identify a mismatch when PPO/GRPO-style clipping
is transplanted to sequences: a fixed clip range systematically reweights short
vs. long responses, distorting the effective objective. Theoretically, we
formalize length fairness via a Length Reweighting Error (LRE) and prove that
small LRE yields a directional cosine guarantee between the clipped and true
updates. FSPO introduces a simple, Gaussian-motivated remedy: we clip the
sequence log-IS ratio with a band that applies a KL-corrected drift term and
scales as $\sqrt{L}$. Empirically, FSPO flattens clip rates across length bins,
stabilizes training, and outperforms all baselines across multiple evaluation
datasets.

*Md Tanveer Hossain Munim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 深度学习天气预测模型的当前评估指标存在"统计相似性陷阱"，奖励模糊预测而错过稀有高影响事件。论文提出DART框架，通过双解码器结构和物理驱动的重采样技术，专门优化极端对流检测，在实际灾害案例中验证了其效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习天气模型的评估指标存在显著缺陷，导致模型过度关注统计相似性而忽视了关键的极端天气事件。这称为"统计相似性陷阱"，使得精细的预测模型在常规指标上表现良好，但在检测危险对流时效果差异。

Method: 提出DART（Dual Architecture for Regression Tasks）框架，采用双解码器结构，明确地将背景与极端事件分解开来。包含物理驱动的重采样技术和任务特定损失函数，将粗糕大气预测转换为高分辨率卫星亮温场。框架支持beta调整进行精确的运营检定。

Result: 实验结果显示：(1)在多个精细基准模型中实证了统计相似性陷阱（相关性达97.9%但危险对流68c0测CSI为0.00）；(2)发现"IVT矛盾"现象，移除集成水气运输反而提高极端对流68c0测效果270%；(3)DART在相同CSI值下偏差仅2.52（基准模型为6.72）；(4)通过2023年8月吉大钢洪洋灾害案例进行实际验证。

Conclusion: DART框架成功解决了深度学习天气模型的统计相似性陷阱问题，专门优化了极端天气事件检测。该方法训练效率高（标准硬件上10分钟内），能够无缝集成到现有气象工作流程中，为极端天气预防提供了可靠的AI解决方案。这是首个系统性解决混合转换-分割-降维任务的研究工作。

Abstract: Current evaluation metrics for deep learning weather models create a
"Statistical Similarity Trap", rewarding blurry predictions while missing rare,
high-impact events. We provide quantitative evidence of this trap, showing
sophisticated baselines achieve 97.9% correlation yet 0.00 CSI for dangerous
convection detection. We introduce DART (Dual Architecture for Regression
Tasks), a framework addressing the challenge of transforming coarse atmospheric
forecasts into high-resolution satellite brightness temperature fields
optimized for extreme convection detection (below 220 K). DART employs
dual-decoder architecture with explicit background/extreme decomposition,
physically motivated oversampling, and task-specific loss functions. We present
four key findings: (1) empirical validation of the Statistical Similarity Trap
across multiple sophisticated baselines; (2) the "IVT Paradox", removing
Integrated Water Vapor Transport, widely regarded as essential for atmospheric
river analysis, improves extreme convection detection by 270%; (3)
architectural necessity demonstrated through operational flexibility (DART
achieves CSI = 0.273 with bias = 2.52 vs. 6.72 for baselines at equivalent
CSI), and (4) real-world validation with the August 2023 Chittagong flooding
disaster as a case study. To our knowledge, this is the first work to
systematically address this hybrid conversion-segmentation-downscaling task,
with no direct prior benchmarks identified in existing literature. Our
validation against diverse statistical and deep learning baselines sufficiently
demonstrates DART's specialized design. The framework enables precise
operational calibration through beta-tuning, trains in under 10 minutes on
standard hardware, and integrates seamlessly with existing meteorological
workflows, demonstrating a pathway toward trustworthy AI for extreme weather
preparedness.

TL;DR: 提出IP3O算法，通过自适应激励机制和渐进惩罚策略解决约束强化学习中的边界稳定性问题，在连续控制任务中实现更好的约束满足和性能平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 约束强化学习在连续控制环境中面临奖励最大化与约束满足之间的平衡挑战，传统策略优化方法在约束边界附近表现不稳定，导致训练性能不佳。

Method: 引入自适应激励机制，在接近约束边界前就保持约束限制；提出IP3O算法，采用渐进增加的惩罚机制来稳定训练动态。

Result: 在基准环境上的实证评估显示，IP3O相比最先进的安全RL算法表现出更好的性能。

Conclusion: IP3O算法有效解决了约束强化学习的稳定性问题，提供了理论保证的最优性误差界限，为安全强化学习提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Constrained Reinforcement Learning (RL) aims to maximize the return while
adhering to predefined constraint limits, which represent domain-specific
safety requirements. In continuous control settings, where learning agents
govern system actions, balancing the trade-off between reward maximization and
constraint satisfaction remains a significant challenge. Policy optimization
methods often exhibit instability near constraint boundaries, resulting in
suboptimal training performance. To address this issue, we introduce a novel
approach that integrates an adaptive incentive mechanism in addition to the
reward structure to stay within the constraint bound before approaching the
constraint boundary. Building on this insight, we propose Incrementally
Penalized Proximal Policy Optimization (IP3O), a practical algorithm that
enforces a progressively increasing penalty to stabilize training dynamics.
Through empirical evaluation on benchmark environments, we demonstrate the
efficacy of IP3O compared to the performance of state-of-the-art Safe RL
algorithms. Furthermore, we provide theoretical guarantees by deriving a bound
on the worst-case error of the optimality achieved by our algorithm.

Abstract: Agro-tourism serves as a strategic economic model designed to facilitate
rural development by diversifying income streams for local communities like
farmers while promoting the conservation of indigenous cultural heritage and
traditional agricultural practices. As a very booming subdomain of tourism,
there is a need to study the strategies for the growth of Agro-tourism in
detail. The current study has identified the important indicators for the
growth and enhancement of agro-tourism. The study is conducted in two phases:
identification of the important indicators through a comprehensive literature
review and in the second phase state-of-the-art techniques were used to
identify the important indicators for the growth of agro-tourism. The
indicators are also called features synonymously, the machine learning models
for feature selection were applied and it was observed that the Least Absolute
Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) method combined with, the machine
Learning Classifiers such as Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Trees (DT),
Random Forest (RF) Tree, and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBOOST) models were
used to suggest the growth of the agro-tourism. The results show that with the
LASSO method, LR model gives the highest classification accuracy of 98% in
70-30% train-test data followed by RF with 95% accuracy. Similarly, in the
80-20% train-test data LR maintains the highest accuracy at 99%, while DT and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决具有丰富结构化状态（如对象类和关系）的决策问题，传统方法难以处理不同规模和结构的问题，需要能够泛化到未见实例的归纳策略。

Method: 将MDP状态表示为实体事实数据库，转换为二分图，通过神经消息传递映射到潜在状态。使用监督学习和强化学习训练策略，采用因子化表示处理不同规模问题。

Result: 在8个RDDL问题域的测试中，Vejde代理在未见实例上的平均得分接近实例特定的MLP代理，且没有显著性能损失，优于在线规划算法Prost。

Conclusion: Vejde框架能够有效生成可泛化的归纳策略，在处理结构化状态决策问题时表现出色，为复杂决策问题的解决方案提供了新途径。

Abstract: We present and evaluate Vejde; a framework which combines data abstraction,
graph neural networks and reinforcement learning to produce inductive policy
functions for decision problems with richly structured states, such as object
classes and relations. MDP states are represented as data bases of facts about
entities, and Vejde converts each state to a bipartite graph, which is mapped
to latent states through neural message passing. The factored representation of
both states and actions allows Vejde agents to handle problems of varying size
and structure. We tested Vejde agents on eight problem domains defined in RDDL,
with ten problem instances each, where policies were trained using both
supervised and reinforcement learning. To test policy generalization, we
separate problem instances in two sets, one for training and the other solely
for testing. Test results on unseen instances for the Vejde agents were
compared to MLP agents trained on each problem instance, as well as the online
planning algorithm Prost. Our results show that Vejde policies in average
generalize to the test instances without a significant loss in score.
Additionally, the inductive agents received scores on unseen test instances
that on average were close to the instance-specific MLP agents.

Motivation: 现有问答模拟器方法存在性能与效率的权衡：LLM-free方法速度快但性能次优，LLM-based方法性能好但推理慢且资源消耗大。需要一种既能保持高效推理又能获得良好性能的解决方案

Method: LDSim（LLM Distillation based Simulator），使用知识蒸馏技术从大型语言模型中提取领域知识和推理能力，用于辅助预测，从而提升模拟性能

Result: 大量实验表明，LDSim在模拟任务和知识追踪任务上都取得了强劲的结果

Conclusion: LDSim通过知识蒸馏有效平衡了性能与效率，为教育推荐系统提供了高质量的模拟数据生成方案

Abstract: The question-answering (QA) simulator is a model that mimics real student
learning behaviors and predicts their correctness of their responses to
questions. QA simulators enable educational recommender systems (ERS) to
collect large amounts of training data without interacting with real students,
thereby preventing harmful recommendations made by an undertrained ERS from
undermining actual student learning. Given the QA history, there are two
categories of solutions to predict the correctness, conducting the simulation:
(1) LLM-free methods, which apply a traditional sequential model to transfer
the QA history into a vector representation first, and make predictions based
on the representation; (2) LLM-based methods, which leverage the domain
knowledge and reasoning capability of LLM to enhence the prediction. LLM-free
methods offer fast inference but generally yield suboptimal performance. In
contrast, most LLM-based methods achieve better results, but at the cost of
slower inference speed and higher GPU memory consumption. In this paper, we
propose a method named LLM Distillation based Simulator (LDSim), which distills
domain knowledge and reasoning capability from an LLM to better assist
prediction, thereby improving simulation performance. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our LDSim achieves strong results on both the simulation task
and the knowledge tracing (KT) task. Our code is publicly available at

Conclusion: MMT-FD框架能够有效解决实际工程应用中故障样本有限和预测模型泛化能力不足的问题，适用于各种类型机械设备的故障诊断

Abstract: The intelligent fault diagnosis of rotating mechanical equipment usually
requires a large amount of labeled sample data. However, in practical
industrial applications, acquiring enough data is both challenging and
expensive in terms of time and cost. Moreover, different types of rotating
mechanical equipment with different unique mechanical properties, require
separate training of diagnostic models for each case. To address the challenges
of limited fault samples and the lack of generalizability in prediction models
for practical engineering applications, we propose a Multi-Attention Meta
Transformer method for few-shot unsupervised rotating machinery fault diagnosis
(MMT-FD). This framework extracts potential fault representations from
unlabeled data and demonstrates strong generalization capabilities, making it
suitable for diagnosing faults across various types of mechanical equipment.
The MMT-FD framework integrates a time-frequency domain encoder and a
meta-learning generalization model. The time-frequency domain encoder predicts
status representations generated through random augmentations in the
time-frequency domain. These enhanced data are then fed into a meta-learning
network for classification and generalization training, followed by fine-tuning
using a limited amount of labeled data. The model is iteratively optimized
using a small number of contrastive learning iterations, resulting in high
efficiency. To validate the framework, we conducted experiments on a bearing
fault dataset and rotor test bench data. The results demonstrate that the
MMT-FD model achieves 99\% fault diagnosis accuracy with only 1\% of labeled
sample data, exhibiting robust generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: EMPG通过调制策略梯度解决了LLM学习动态中的根本问题，为长时程任务中的信用分配提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: In long-horizon tasks, recent agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs)
face a significant challenge that sparse, outcome-based rewards make it
difficult to assign credit to intermediate steps. Previous methods mainly focus
on creating dense reward signals to guide learning, either through traditional
reinforcement learning techniques like inverse reinforcement learning or by
using Process Reward Models for step-by-step feedback. In this paper, we
identify a fundamental problem in the learning dynamics of LLMs: the magnitude
of policy gradients is inherently coupled with the entropy, which leads to
inefficient small updates for confident correct actions and potentially
destabilizes large updates for uncertain ones. To resolve this, we propose
Entropy-Modulated Policy Gradients (EMPG), a framework that re-calibrates the
learning signal based on step-wise uncertainty and the final task outcome. EMPG
amplifies updates for confident correct actions, penalizes confident errors,
and attenuates updates from uncertain steps to stabilize exploration. We
further introduce a bonus term for future clarity that encourages agents to
find more predictable solution paths. Through comprehensive experiments on
three challenging agent tasks, WebShop, ALFWorld, and Deep Search, we
demonstrate that EMPG achieves substantial performance gains and significantly
outperforms strong policy gradient baselines. Project page is at

Abstract: Data-driven discovery of emergent dynamics is gaining popularity,
particularly in the context of reaction-diffusion systems. These systems are
widely studied across various fields, including neuroscience, ecology,
epidemiology, and several other subject areas that deal with emergent dynamics.
A current challenge in the discovery process relates to system identification
when there is no prior knowledge of the underlying physics. We attempt to
address this challenge by learning Soft Artificial Life (Soft ALife) models,
such as Agent-based and Cellular Automata (CA) models, from observed data for
reaction-diffusion systems. In this paper, we present findings on the
applicability of a conceptual framework, the Data-driven Rulesets for Soft
Artificial Life (DRSALife) model, to learn Soft ALife rulesets that accurately
represent emergent dynamics in a reaction-diffusion system from observed data.
This model has demonstrated promising results for Elementary CA Rule 30, Game
of Life, and Vicsek Flocking problems in recent work. To our knowledge, this is
one of the few studies that explore machine-based Soft ALife ruleset learning
and system identification for reaction-diffusion dynamics without any prior
knowledge of the underlying physics. Moreover, we provide comprehensive
findings from experiments investigating the potential effects of using noisy
and sparse observed datasets on learning emergent dynamics. Additionally, we
successfully identify the structure and parameters of the underlying partial
differential equations (PDEs) representing these dynamics. Experimental results
demonstrate that the learned models are able to predict the emergent dynamics
with good accuracy (74%) and exhibit quite robust performance when subjected to
Gaussian noise and temporal sparsity.

Conclusion: MoSE框架通过混合专家模型有效提升了GNN的结构表达能力和灵活性，适用于多种图任务并提供可解释性。

Abstract: While graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved great success in learning
from graph-structured data, their reliance on local, pairwise message passing
restricts their ability to capture complex, high-order subgraph patterns.
leading to insufficient structural expressiveness. Recent efforts have
attempted to enhance structural expressiveness by integrating random walk
kernels into GNNs. However, these methods are inherently designed for
graph-level tasks, which limits their applicability to other downstream tasks
such as node classification. Moreover, their fixed kernel configurations hinder
the model's flexibility in capturing diverse subgraph structures. To address
these limitations, this paper proposes a novel Mixture of Subgraph Experts
(MoSE) framework for flexible and expressive subgraph-based representation
learning across diverse graph tasks. Specifically, MoSE extracts informative
subgraphs via anonymous walks and dynamically routes them to specialized
experts based on structural semantics, enabling the model to capture diverse
subgraph patterns with improved flexibility and interpretability. We further
provide a theoretical analysis of MoSE's expressivity within the Subgraph
Weisfeiler-Lehman (SWL) Test, proving that it is more powerful than SWL.
Extensive experiments, together with visualizations of learned subgraph
experts, demonstrate that MoSE not only outperforms competitive baselines but
also provides interpretable insights into structural patterns learned by the
model.

Conclusion: 提出的多项式核方法为HGR计算提供了更可靠的实际应用方案，解决了现有方法的稳健性问题。

Abstract: The Hirschfeld-Gebelein-R\'enyi (HGR) correlation coefficient is an extension
of Pearson's correlation that is not limited to linear correlations, with
potential applications in algorithmic fairness, scientific analysis, and causal
discovery. Recently, novel algorithms to estimate HGR in a differentiable
manner have been proposed to facilitate its use as a loss regularizer in
constrained machine learning applications. However, the inherent
uncomputability of HGR requires a bias-variance trade-off, which can possibly
compromise the robustness of the proposed methods, hence raising technical
concerns if applied in real-world scenarios. We introduce a novel computational
approach for HGR that relies on user-configurable polynomial kernels, offering
greater robustness compared to previous methods and featuring a faster yet
almost equally effective restriction. Our approach provides significant
advantages in terms of robustness and determinism, making it a more reliable
option for real-world applications. Moreover, we present a brief experimental
analysis to validate the applicability of our approach within a constrained
machine learning framework, showing that its computation yields an insightful
subgradient that can serve as a loss regularizer.

Method: 利用历史实验结果的SHAP解释，结合元学习和LLM推理，采用LLM-as-judge评估来控制输出格式、准确性和完整性。

Result: 在8个医学影像数据集上，MetaLLMiX性能优于传统HPO方法，计算成本大幅降低，在5/8任务上达到最优结果，响应时间减少99.6-99.9%，训练速度提升2.4-15.7倍。

Conclusion: MetaLLMiX提供了一种高效、低成本的超参数优化解决方案，在保持准确性的同时显著提升效率，优于现有的API驱动方法。

Abstract: Effective model and hyperparameter selection remains a major challenge in
deep learning, often requiring extensive expertise and computation. While
AutoML and large language models (LLMs) promise automation, current LLM-based
approaches rely on trial and error and expensive APIs, which provide limited
interpretability and generalizability. We propose MetaLLMiX, a zero-shot

SHAP explanations, MetaLLMiX recommends optimal hyperparameters and pretrained
models without additional trials. We further employ an LLM-as-judge evaluation
to control output format, accuracy, and completeness. Experiments on eight
medical imaging datasets using nine open-source lightweight LLMs show that
MetaLLMiX achieves competitive or superior performance to traditional HPO
methods while drastically reducing computational cost. Our local deployment
outperforms prior API-based approaches, achieving optimal results on 5 of 8
tasks, response time reductions of 99.6-99.9%, and the fastest training times
on 6 datasets (2.4-15.7x faster), maintaining accuracy within 1-5% of

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型生成的反事实解释虽然有效但不够简洁，在要求生成最小修改时又往往无法改变预测结果，存在有效性-简洁性权衡问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语言模型如何通过自我生成的反事实解释来向人类解释其决策过程，这对于人机协作至关重要

Method: 评估LLMs生成的反事实解释的有效性（能否改变预测结果）和简洁性（修改程度是否最小化），在多个模型、数据集和评估设置下进行测试

Result: LLMs通常能生成有效的反事实解释但不够简洁；当要求生成最小修改时，往往做出过小的编辑而无法改变预测结果

Conclusion: 自我生成的反事实解释作为可解释性工具效果有限，甚至可能提供误导性见解，在关键应用中部署LLMs时需要考虑不可靠自我解释的影响

Abstract: To collaborate effectively with humans, language models must be able to
explain their decisions in natural language. We study a specific type of
self-explanation: self-generated counterfactual explanations (SCEs), where a
model explains its prediction by modifying the input such that it would have
predicted a different outcome. We evaluate whether LLMs can produce SCEs that
are valid, achieving the intended outcome, and minimal, modifying the input no
more than necessary. When asked to generate counterfactuals, we find that LLMs
typically produce SCEs that are valid, but far from minimal, offering little
insight into their decision-making behaviour. Worryingly, when asked to
generate minimal counterfactuals, LLMs typically make excessively small edits
that fail to change predictions. The observed validity-minimality trade-off is
consistent across several LLMs, datasets, and evaluation settings. Our findings
suggest that SCEs are, at best, an ineffective explainability tool and, at
worst, can provide misleading insights into model behaviour. Proposals to
deploy LLMs in high-stakes settings must consider the impact of unreliable
self-explanations on downstream decision-making. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 基于TabPFN模型的Kriging先验回归(KpR)方法，通过空间滞后特征将机器学习与地统统计相结合，在精准农业数字土壤制图中显著提升预测准确性和不确定性估计能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习和地统统计在土壤属性预测中各有优势，前者抓取环境特征与土壤属性的关系，后者利用空间结构。需要一种混合框架来结合两者优点

Method: 提出kriging prior regression (KpR)方法，通过平凡克里金工程化生成'空间滞后'特征，并与TabPFN模型结合。与回归克里金的逻辑相反

Result: 在6个LimeSoDa地区数据集上，KpR与TabPFN组合显示出可靠的不确定性估计和更高的预测准确性，相比其他空间技术和非空间机器学习算法，平均R2提升约30%，特别适用于小样本量预测任务

Conclusion: KpR与TabPFN组合构成了一个非常稳健且多用途的模型框架，适用于精准农业中的数字土壤制图，能够补偿近程土壤感知数据有限时感知特征与土壤属性间关联弱的情况

Abstract: Machine learning and geostatistics are two fundamentally different frameworks
for predicting and spatially mapping soil properties. Geostatistics leverages
the spatial structure of soil properties, while machine learning captures the
relationship between available environmental features and soil properties. We
propose a hybrid framework that enriches ML with spatial context through
engineering of 'spatial lag' features from ordinary kriging. We call this
approach 'kriging prior regression' (KpR), as it follows the inverse logic of
regression kriging. To evaluate this approach, we assessed both the point and
probabilistic prediction performance of KpR, using the TabPFN model across six
fieldscale datasets from LimeSoDa. These datasets included soil organic carbon,
clay content, and pH, along with features derived from remote sensing and
in-situ proximal soil sensing. KpR with TabPFN demonstrated reliable
uncertainty estimates and more accurate predictions in comparison to several
other spatial techniques (e.g., regression/residual kriging with TabPFN), as
well as to established non-spatial machine learning algorithms (e.g., random
forest). Most notably, it significantly improved the average R2 by around 30%
compared to machine learning algorithms without spatial context. This
improvement was due to the strong prediction performance of the TabPFN
algorithm itself and the complementary spatial information provided by KpR
features. TabPFN is particularly effective for prediction tasks with small
sample sizes, common in precision agriculture, whereas KpR can compensate for
weak relationships between sensing features and soil properties when proximal
soil sensing data are limited. Hence, we conclude that KpR with TabPFN is a
very robust and versatile modelling framework for digital soil mapping in
precision agriculture.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究提出了fuser算法和SAC验证框架，用于分析微生物群落在不同环境条件下的动态关联网络，相比传统方法在跨环境预测中表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统微生物共现网络推断算法通常只分析单一环境下的静态关联，无法捕捉微生物群落在不同生态条件下的动态适应过程，需要开发能够处理多环境数据的算法。

Method: 提出Same-All Cross-validation (SAC)验证框架，评估算法在相同环境内和跨环境下的预测性能；开发fuser算法，在训练时保留特定子样本信号的同时跨环境共享相关信息，生成环境特异的预测网络。

Result: fuser算法在相同环境内预测性能与glmnet相当，在跨环境场景中显著降低了测试误差，优于基线算法。

Conclusion: fuser算法能够有效捕捉微生物群落在不同环境条件下的动态关联模式，为微生物生态学研究提供了更准确的网络推断工具。

Abstract: Co-occurrence network inference algorithms have significantly advanced our
understanding of microbiome communities. However, these algorithms typically
analyze microbial associations within samples collected from a single
environmental niche, often capturing only static snapshots rather than dynamic
microbial processes. Previous studies have commonly grouped samples from
different environmental niches together without fully considering how microbial
communities adapt their associations when faced with varying ecological
conditions. Our study addresses this limitation by explicitly investigating
both spatial and temporal dynamics of microbial communities. We analyzed
publicly available microbiome abundance data across multiple locations and time
points, to evaluate algorithm performance in predicting microbial associations
using our proposed Same-All Cross-validation (SAC) framework. SAC evaluates
algorithms in two distinct scenarios: training and testing within the same
environmental niche (Same), and training and testing on combined data from
multiple environmental niches (All). To overcome the limitations of
conventional algorithms, we propose fuser, an algorithm that, while not
entirely new in machine learning, is novel for microbiome community network
inference. It retains subsample-specific signals while simultaneously sharing
relevant information across environments during training. Unlike standard
approaches that infer a single generalized network from combined data, fuser
generates distinct, environment-specific predictive networks. Our results
demonstrate that fuser achieves comparable predictive performance to existing
algorithms such as glmnet when evaluated within homogeneous environments
(Same), and notably reduces test error compared to baseline algorithms in
cross-environment (All) scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图扩散模型在多条件设置下效果有限，依赖联合条件或连续松弛会损害保真度，需要更好的可控分子生成方法

Method: 提出CSGD模型，基于concrete scores实现离散图的score matching，并引入Composable Guidance (CoG)实现细粒度条件控制和Probability Calibration (PC)缓解训练-测试不匹配

Result: 在四个分子数据集上平均可控性提升15.3%，同时保持高有效性和分布保真度

Conclusion: 基于score的建模在离散图生成中具有实际优势，能够实现灵活的多属性分子设计

Abstract: Controllable molecular graph generation is essential for material and drug
discovery, where generated molecules must satisfy diverse property constraints.
While recent advances in graph diffusion models have improved generation
quality, their effectiveness in multi-conditional settings remains limited due
to reliance on joint conditioning or continuous relaxations that compromise
fidelity. To address these limitations, we propose Composable Score-based Graph
Diffusion model (CSGD), the first model that extends score matching to discrete
graphs via concrete scores, enabling flexible and principled manipulation of
conditional guidance. Building on this foundation, we introduce two score-based
techniques: Composable Guidance (CoG), which allows fine-grained control over
arbitrary subsets of conditions during sampling, and Probability Calibration
(PC), which adjusts estimated transition probabilities to mitigate train-test
mismatches. Empirical results on four molecular datasets show that CSGD
achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a 15.3% average improvement in
controllability over prior methods, while maintaining high validity and
distributional fidelity. Our findings highlight the practical advantages of
score-based modeling for discrete graph generation and its capacity for
flexible, multi-property molecular design.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了AquaCast深度学习模型，通过多输入多输出架构融合内源变量和外源因素，在城市水动力预测中实现最先进性能，并在真实和合成数据集上验证了其鲁棒性和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决城市水动力预测中传统方法难以同时捕捉变量间依赖关系和时间依赖关系的挑战，需要有效整合内源变量（如水位、流量）和外源因素（如降水历史和预报）进行准确预测。

Method: 开发AquaCast多输入多输出深度学习模型，使用嵌入层融合外源输入，避免对外源变量进行预测，专注于内源变量的预测，同时捕捉所有输入的变量间和时间依赖关系。

Result: 在LausanneCity数据集上仅使用内源变量就达到最先进性能，加入外源变量和预报后性能进一步提升。在三个大规模合成数据集（MeteoSwiss、Lorenz Attractors、Random Fields）上均优于现有基线，表现出良好的泛化能力和可扩展性。

Conclusion: AquaCast模型能够有效整合内源和外源信息，在城市水动力预测中实现准确、鲁棒的预测性能，并在不同时间复杂度的数据集上展现出良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: This work addresses the challenge of forecasting urban water dynamics by
developing a multi-input, multi-output deep learning model that incorporates
both endogenous variables (e.g., water height or discharge) and exogenous
factors (e.g., precipitation history and forecast reports). Unlike conventional
forecasting, the proposed model, AquaCast, captures both inter-variable and
temporal dependencies across all inputs, while focusing forecast solely on
endogenous variables. Exogenous inputs are fused via an embedding layer,
eliminating the need to forecast them and enabling the model to attend to their
short-term influences more effectively. We evaluate our approach on the
LausanneCity dataset, which includes measurements from four urban drainage
sensors, and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance when using only
endogenous variables. Performance also improves with the inclusion of exogenous
variables and forecast reports. To assess generalization and scalability, we
additionally test the model on three large-scale synthesized datasets,
generated from MeteoSwiss records, the Lorenz Attractors model, and the Random
Fields model, each representing a different level of temporal complexity across
100 nodes. The results confirm that our model consistently outperforms existing
baselines and maintains a robust and accurate forecast across both real and
synthetic datasets.

potential of task-oriented AI agents to not only filter information but also to
actively participate in and accelerate the workflows of the academic community.

Motivation: 现有DPSGD的静态噪声机制影响模型性能，且随着模型参数指数增长，随机优化器的学习效率面临挑战

Method: 结合动态差分隐私（自动梯度裁剪）和随机投影SGD，动态调整效用与隐私的权衡

Result: 在不同目标函数上表现出可证明的次线性收敛率，实验显示在保持隐私的同时显著提高准确率

Conclusion: D2P2-SGD通过动态隐私和随机投影技术，有效解决了隐私保护与模型性能的平衡问题

Abstract: Stochastic optimization is a pivotal enabler in modern machine learning,
producing effective models for various tasks. However, several existing works
have shown that model parameters and gradient information are susceptible to
privacy leakage. Although Differentially Private SGD (DPSGD) addresses privacy
concerns, its static noise mechanism impacts the error bounds for model
performance. Additionally, with the exponential increase in model parameters,
efficient learning of these models using stochastic optimizers has become more
challenging. To address these concerns, we introduce the Dynamically
Differentially Private Projected SGD (D2P2-SGD) optimizer. In D2P2-SGD, we
combine two important ideas: (i) dynamic differential privacy (DDP) with
automatic gradient clipping and (ii) random projection with SGD, allowing
dynamic adjustment of the tradeoff between utility and privacy of the model. It
exhibits provably sub-linear convergence rates across different objective
functions, matching the best available rate. The theoretical analysis further
suggests that DDP leads to better utility at the cost of privacy, while random
projection enables more efficient model learning. Extensive experiments across
diverse datasets show that D2P2-SGD remarkably enhances accuracy while
maintaining privacy. Our code is available here.

Abstract: Solutions to the Algorithm Selection Problem (ASP) in machine learning face
the challenge of high computational costs associated with evaluating various
algorithms' performances on a given dataset. To mitigate this cost, the
meta-learning field can leverage previously executed experiments shared in
online repositories such as OpenML. OpenML provides an extensive collection of
machine learning experiments. However, an analysis of OpenML's records reveals
limitations. It lacks diversity in pipelines, specifically when exploring data
preprocessing steps/blocks, such as scaling or imputation, resulting in limited
representation. Its experiments are often focused on a few popular techniques
within each pipeline block, leading to an imbalanced sample. To overcome the
observed limitations of OpenML, we propose PIPES, a collection of experiments
involving multiple pipelines designed to represent all combinations of the
selected sets of techniques, aiming at diversity and completeness. PIPES stores
the results of experiments performed applying 9,408 pipelines to 300 datasets.
It includes detailed information on the pipeline blocks, training and testing
times, predictions, performances, and the eventual error messages. This
comprehensive collection of results allows researchers to perform analyses
across diverse and representative pipelines and datasets. PIPES also offers
potential for expansion, as additional data and experiments can be incorporated
to support the meta-learning community further. The data, code, supplementary
material, and all experiments can be found at

Result: 多分类分类准确率达到74.87%，二元分类在所有类别对中均超70%以上。流感类别最易区分，健康类别最难区分。统计测验显示多分类与二元分类模型性能无显著差异(p=0.149和0.125)。

Conclusion: 少样本学习在呼吸音分类中可以获得竞争力的性能，多分类分类在这个场景下是可行的。这为在标注数据有限的医疗诊断领域应用少样本学习提供了支撑。

Abstract: This paper investigates the effectiveness of few-shot learning for
respiratory sound classification, focusing on coughbased detection of COVID-19,
Flu, and healthy conditions. We leverage Prototypical Networks with spectrogram
representations of cough sounds to address the challenge of limited labeled
data. Our study evaluates whether few-shot learning can enable models to
achieve performance comparable to traditional deep learning approaches while
using significantly fewer training samples. Additionally, we compare
multi-class and binary classification models to assess whether multi-class
models can perform comparably to their binary counterparts. Experimental
findings show that few-shot learning models can achieve competitive accuracy.
Our model attains 74.87% accuracy in multi-class classification with only 15
support examples per class, while binary classification achieves over 70%
accuracy across all class pairs. Class-wise analysis reveals Flu as the most
distinguishable class, and Healthy as the most challenging. Statistical tests
(paired t-test p = 0.149, Wilcoxon p = 0.125) indicate no significant
performance difference between binary and multiclass models, supporting the
viability of multi-class classification in this setting. These results
highlight the feasibility of applying few-shot learning in medical diagnostics,
particularly when large labeled datasets are unavailable.

Conclusion: 双视角方法在拜占庭鲁棒联邦学习中具有显著效果，能够有效区分诚实客户端和恶意攻击

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) emerged as a widely studied paradigm for distributed
learning. Despite its many advantages, FL remains vulnerable to adversarial
attacks, especially under data heterogeneity. We propose a new Byzantine-robust
FL algorithm called ProDiGy. The key novelty lies in evaluating the client
gradients using a joint dual scoring system based on the gradients' proximity
and dissimilarity. We demonstrate through extensive numerical experiments that
ProDiGy outperforms existing defenses in various scenarios. In particular, when
the clients' data do not follow an IID distribution, while other defense
mechanisms fail, ProDiGy maintains strong defense capabilities and model
accuracy. These findings highlight the effectiveness of a dual perspective
approach that promotes natural similarity among honest clients while detecting
suspicious uniformity as a potential indicator of an attack.

Conclusion: 该框架通过同时处理节点区分度和几何一致性，显著提升了无监督图对齐的性能，并展示了跨领域的泛化能力。

Abstract: Graph alignment-the problem of identifying corresponding nodes across
multiple graphs-is fundamental to numerous applications. Most existing
unsupervised methods embed node features into latent representations to enable
cross-graph comparison without ground-truth correspondences. However, these
methods suffer from two critical limitations: the degradation of node
distinctiveness due to oversmoothing in GNN-based embeddings, and the
misalignment of latent spaces across graphs caused by structural noise, feature
heterogeneity, and training instability, ultimately leading to unreliable node
correspondences. We propose a novel graph alignment framework that
simultaneously enhances node distinctiveness and enforces geometric consistency
across latent spaces. Our approach introduces a dual-pass encoder that combines
low-pass and high-pass spectral filters to generate embeddings that are both
structure-aware and highly discriminative. To address latent space
misalignment, we incorporate a geometry-aware functional map module that learns
bijective and isometric transformations between graph embeddings, ensuring
consistent geometric relationships across different representations. Extensive
experiments on graph benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms existing unsupervised alignment baselines, exhibiting superior
robustness to structural inconsistencies and challenging alignment scenarios.
Additionally, comprehensive evaluation on vision-language benchmarks using
diverse pretrained models shows that our framework effectively generalizes
beyond graph domains, enabling unsupervised alignment of vision and language
representations.

Abstract: We present a deep learning emulator for stochastic and chaotic
spatio-temporal systems, explicitly conditioned on the parameter values of the
underlying partial differential equations (PDEs). Our approach involves
pre-training the model on a single parameter domain, followed by fine-tuning on
a smaller, yet diverse dataset, enabling generalisation across a broad range of
parameter values. By incorporating local attention mechanisms, the network is
capable of handling varying domain sizes and resolutions. This enables
computationally efficient pre-training on smaller domains while requiring only
a small additional dataset to learn how to generalise to larger domain sizes.
We demonstrate the model's capabilities on the chaotic Kuramoto-Sivashinsky
equation and stochastically-forced beta-plane turbulence, showcasing its
ability to capture phenomena at interpolated parameter values. The emulator
provides significant computational speed-ups over conventional numerical
integration, facilitating efficient exploration of parameter space, while a
probabilistic variant of the emulator provides uncertainty quantification,
allowing for the statistical study of rare events.

Abstract: We propose a novel data-lean operator learning algorithm, the Reduced Basis

Generative Pre-Trained Physics-Informed Neural Networks, ReBaNO relies on a
mathematically rigorous greedy algorithm to build its network structure offline
adaptively from the ground up. Knowledge distillation via task-specific
activation function allows ReBaNO to have a compact architecture requiring
minimal computational cost online while embedding physics. In comparison to
state-of-the-art operator learning algorithms such as PCA-Net, DeepONet, FNO,

them in terms of eliminating/shrinking the generalization gap for both in- and
out-of-distribution tests and being the only operator learning algorithm
achieving strict discretization invariance.

Conclusion: 基于GCEs演化的解释方法为概念漂移提供了更全面的诊断视角，有助于理解模型决策逻辑的变化机制

Abstract: Machine learning models in dynamic environments often suffer from concept
drift, where changes in the data distribution degrade performance. While
detecting this drift is a well-studied topic, explaining how and why the
model's decision-making logic changes still remains a significant challenge. In
this paper, we introduce a novel methodology to explain concept drift by
analyzing the temporal evolution of group-based counterfactual explanations
(GCEs). Our approach tracks shifts in the GCEs' cluster centroids and their
associated counterfactual action vectors before and after a drift. These
evolving GCEs act as an interpretable proxy, revealing structural changes in
the model's decision boundary and its underlying rationale. We operationalize
this analysis within a three-layer framework that synergistically combines
insights from the data layer (distributional shifts), the model layer
(prediction disagreement), and our proposed explanation layer. We show that
such holistic view allows for a more comprehensive diagnosis of drift, making
it possible to distinguish between different root causes, such as a spatial
data shift versus a re-labeling of concepts.

Method: 提出功能基团表示(FGR)框架，整合两类功能基团：基于化学知识定义的功能基团(FG)和使用序列模式挖掘从大规模分子语料库中发现的功能基团(MFG)。通过预训练将分子编码到低维潜在空间，并可包含基于2D结构的分子描述符。

Result: 在33个涵盖物理化学、生物物理、量子力学、生物活性和药代动力学的基准数据集上达到最先进性能，同时保持化学可解释性。

Conclusion: FGR框架是开发高性能且化学可解释的深度学习分子发现模型的重要进展，使化学家能够直接将预测性质与特定功能基团联系起来。

Abstract: Molecular property prediction using deep learning (DL) models has accelerated
drug and materials discovery, but the resulting DL models often lack
interpretability, hindering their adoption by chemists. This work proposes
developing molecule representations using the concept of Functional Groups (FG)
in chemistry. We introduce the Functional Group Representation (FGR) framework,
a novel approach to encoding molecules based on their fundamental chemical
substructures. Our method integrates two types of functional groups: those
curated from established chemical knowledge (FG), and those mined from a large
molecular corpus using sequential pattern mining (MFG). The resulting FGR
framework encodes molecules into a lower-dimensional latent space by leveraging
pre-training on a large dataset of unlabeled molecules. Furthermore, the
proposed framework allows the inclusion of 2D structure-based descriptors of
molecules. We demonstrate that the FGR framework achieves state-of-the-art
performance on a diverse range of 33 benchmark datasets spanning physical
chemistry, biophysics, quantum mechanics, biological activity, and
pharmacokinetics while enabling chemical interpretability. Crucially, the
model's representations are intrinsically aligned with established chemical
principles, allowing chemists to directly link predicted properties to specific
functional groups and facilitating novel insights into structure-property
relationships. Our work presents a significant step toward developing
high-performing, chemically interpretable DL models for molecular discovery.

TL;DR: FG-FARL是一种离线强化学习方法，通过校准各群体安全阈值来减少伤害并平衡受保护子群体间的公平性目标（覆盖率或伤害）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决在医疗保健等高风险领域中强化学习系统可能对不同人口统计群体造成不公平伤害的问题，需要开发能够同时保证安全性和公平性的决策支持方法。

Method: 提出可行性引导的公平自适应强化学习（FG-FARL），使用去标识化的医疗补助人群健康管理项目纵向轨迹数据，通过校准每个群体的安全阈值来减少伤害并平衡公平性目标。

Result: FG-FARL在保持与基线方法（行为克隆和HACO）相当的价值估计的同时，显著改善了公平性指标，展示了更安全和更公平的决策支持能力。

Conclusion: FG-FARL提供了一种实用的路径，能够在保持决策价值的同时实现更安全和更公平的强化学习系统，特别适用于医疗保健等高风险应用场景。

Abstract: We introduce Feasibility-Guided Fair Adaptive Reinforcement Learning
(FG-FARL), an offline RL procedure that calibrates per-group safety thresholds
to reduce harm while equalizing a chosen fairness target (coverage or harm)
across protected subgroups. Using de-identified longitudinal trajectories from
a Medicaid population health management program, we evaluate FG-FARL against
behavior cloning (BC) and HACO (Hybrid Adaptive Conformal Offline RL; a global
conformal safety baseline). We report off-policy value estimates with bootstrap
95% confidence intervals and subgroup disparity analyses with p-values. FG-FARL
achieves comparable value to baselines while improving fairness metrics,
demonstrating a practical path to safer and more equitable decision support.

TL;DR: ButterflyQuant是一种新的2位量化方法，通过可学习的蝴蝶变换替代固定Hadamard变换，自适应处理不同Transformer层的异常值模式，显著提升大语言模型低精度量化的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有2位量化方法使用固定的正交变换（如Hadamard矩阵）处理激活值中的异常值，但无法适应不同Transformer层特有的异常值分布模式，导致性能损失严重。

Method: 提出ButterflyQuant方法：1）用可学习的蝴蝶变换替代固定Hadamard变换，通过连续Givens旋转角度参数化；2）引入均匀性正则化使变换后激活值分布更平滑；3）仅需128个校准样本和单GPU几分钟训练时间。

Result: 在LLaMA-2-7B模型上，2位量化的困惑度从QuaRot的22.1降至15.4，显著提升了量化性能。

Conclusion: ButterflyQuant通过层自适应的可学习正交变换，有效解决了极端量化中的异常值问题，以可忽略的一次性计算成本实现了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Large language models require massive memory footprints, severely limiting
deployment on consumer hardware. Quantization reduces memory through lower
numerical precision, but extreme 2-bit quantization suffers from catastrophic
performance loss due to outliers in activations. Rotation-based methods such as
QuIP and QuaRot apply orthogonal transforms to eliminate outliers before
quantization, using computational invariance: $\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{Wx} =
(\mathbf{WQ}^T)(\mathbf{Qx})$ for orthogonal $\mathbf{Q}$. However, these
methods use fixed transforms--Hadamard matrices achieving optimal worst-case
coherence $\mu = 1/\sqrt{n}$--that cannot adapt to specific weight
distributions. We identify that different transformer layers exhibit distinct
outlier patterns, motivating layer-adaptive rotations rather than
one-size-fits-all approaches. We propose ButterflyQuant, which replaces
Hadamard rotations with learnable butterfly transforms parameterized by
continuous Givens rotation angles. Unlike Hadamard's discrete $\{+1, -1\}$
entries that are non-differentiable and prohibit gradient-based learning,
butterfly transforms' continuous parameterization enables smooth optimization
while guaranteeing orthogonality by construction. This orthogonal constraint
ensures theoretical guarantees in outlier suppression while achieving $O(n \log
n)$ computational complexity with only $\frac{n \log n}{2}$ learnable
parameters. We further introduce a uniformity regularization on
post-transformation activations to promote smoother distributions amenable to
quantization. Learning requires only 128 calibration samples and converges in
minutes on a single GPU--a negligible one-time cost. On LLaMA-2-7B with 2-bit
quantization, ButterflyQuant achieves 15.4 perplexity versus 22.1 for QuaRot.
