TL;DR: CHAIR-DPO方法利用CHAIR指标构建偏好数据，通过直接偏好优化减少多模态大语言模型的幻觉问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型存在严重的幻觉问题，即生成与视觉输入不符的回答，需要一种简单有效的对齐方法来减少幻觉

Method: 使用CHAIR指标自动区分幻觉和非幻觉样本对，通过直接偏好优化(DPO)对现有多模态大语言模型进行微调

Result: CHAIR-DPO方法在多个幻觉基准测试中有效减少了幻觉回答的数量

Conclusion: 基于CHAIR指标的奖励机制可以有效地通过DPO微调减少多模态大语言模型的幻觉问题，且方法简单无需复杂流程

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) emerge as a unified interface to
address a multitude of tasks, ranging from NLP to computer vision. Despite
showcasing state-of-the-art results in many benchmarks, a long-standing issue
is the tendency of MLLMs to hallucinate, that is to generate answers to the
user's query that are not reflected in the visual input. In this paper, we
address the problem of hallucinations as an alignment problem, seeking to steer
the MLLM so that it prefers generating content without hallucinations. In
contrast to recent approaches that require complicated pipelines to build
synthetic preference data for alignment training, often relying on proprietary
models, we capitalize on the well-known CHAIR metric, originally proposed to
gauge the degree of hallucinations in image captioning. Given a pair of
generated answers, we leverage CHAIR to distinguish winner and loser options
(i.e., non-hallucinated and hallucinated samples) and fine-tune off-the-shelf
MLLMs via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). The resulting method, which we
refer to as CHAIR-DPO, effectively diminishes the amount of hallucinated
answers on several hallucination benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of
fine-tuning the MLLM with a CHAIR-based reward. Source code and trained models
are publicly available at https://github.com/aimagelab/CHAIR-DPO.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 基于Stable Diffusion 3的多模态框架，通过将伪造残差作为显式模态融合到潜在空间，实现了高效准确的图片伪造定位方法，无需压力标注数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图片伪造定位方法依赖人工标注数据，成本高且难以跟上多模态大模型带来的图片操纷技术发展。

Method: 利用SD3的多模态处理能力，将高频伪造残差信号作为显式模态融入潜在空间，保留输入图片的丰富语义信息。

Result: 在广泛使用的测试集上超过现有最佳方法12%，甚至在未见过的真实文档伪造和自然场景图片上也表现良好。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了依赖标注数据的问题，为图片伪造检测领域提供了一种更高效、准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Driven by the new generation of multi-modal large models, such as Stable
Diffusion (SD), image manipulation technologies have advanced rapidly, posing
significant challenges to image forensics. However, existing image forgery
localization methods, which heavily rely on labor-intensive and costly
annotated data, are struggling to keep pace with these emerging image
manipulation technologies. To address these challenges, we are the first to
integrate both image generation and powerful perceptual capabilities of SD into
an image forensic framework, enabling more efficient and accurate forgery
localization. First, we theoretically show that the multi-modal architecture of
SD can be conditioned on forgery-related information, enabling the model to
inherently output forgery localization results. Then, building on this
foundation, we specifically leverage the multimodal framework of Stable
DiffusionV3 (SD3) to enhance forgery localization performance.We leverage the
multi-modal processing capabilities of SD3 in the latent space by treating
image forgery residuals -- high-frequency signals extracted using specific
highpass filters -- as an explicit modality. This modality is fused into the
latent space during training to enhance forgery localization performance.
Notably, our method fully preserves the latent features extracted by SD3,
thereby retaining the rich semantic information of the input image.
Experimental results show that our framework achieves up to 12% improvements in
performance on widely used benchmarking datasets compared to current
state-of-the-art image forgery localization models. Encouragingly, the model
demonstrates strong performance on forensic tasks involving real-world document
forgery images and natural scene forging images, even when such data were
entirely unseen during training.

### [3] [Grounding Multimodal Large Language Models with Quantitative Skin Attributes: A Retrieval Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20188)

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究探索将多模态大语言模型与定量属性相结合，通过微调使模型能从图像预测皮肤病变属性值，从而提高AI皮肤疾病诊断模型的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI模型在皮肤疾病诊断方面表现出色，但模型预测的可解释性仍需大幅提升才能实际应用。需要找到提高诊断解释性的方法。

Method: 结合多模态大语言模型和定量属性使用，通过微调使MLLM能从图像预测病变属性值，并在SLICE-3D数据集上进行基于属性的图像检索案例研究。

Result: 研究表明MLLM嵌入空间可以通过微调来预测病变属性值，从而实现与定量属性的关联性。

Conclusion: 多模态大语言模型与定量属性的结合为提高AI皮肤疾病诊断模型的可解释性提供了有前景的途径。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence models have demonstrated significant success in
diagnosing skin diseases, including cancer, showing the potential to assist
clinicians in their analysis. However, the interpretability of model
predictions must be significantly improved before they can be used in practice.
To this end, we explore the combination of two promising approaches: Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) and quantitative attribute usage. MLLMs offer a
potential avenue for increased interpretability, providing reasoning for
diagnosis in natural language through an interactive format. Separately, a
number of quantitative attributes that are related to lesion appearance (e.g.,
lesion area) have recently been found predictive of malignancy with high
accuracy. Predictions grounded as a function of such concepts have the
potential for improved interpretability. We provide evidence that MLLM
embedding spaces can be grounded in such attributes, through fine-tuning to
predict their values from images. Concretely, we evaluate this grounding in the
embedding space through an attribute-specific content-based image retrieval
case study using the SLICE-3D dataset.

### [4] [Enhancing Automatic Modulation Recognition With a Reconstruction-Driven Vision Transformer Under Limited Labels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20193)
*Hossein Ahmadi,Banafsheh Saffari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于Vision Transformer的统一框架，结合监督、自监督和重建目标，在少量标注数据下实现高效自动调制识别


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AMR解决方案依赖大量标注数据或多阶段训练流程，限制了实际应用中的可扩展性和泛化能力

Method: 使用ViT编码器、轻量卷积解码器和线性分类器，通过重建分支将增强信号映射回原始信号，在预训练中学习鲁棒特征，微调时使用部分标签监督

Result: 在RML2018.01A数据集上，低标签情况下优于监督CNN和ViT基线，仅用15-20%标注数据即可达到ResNet水平精度，在不同SNR下保持强劲性能

Conclusion: 该框架为AMR提供了简单、可泛化且标签高效的解决方案

Abstract: Automatic modulation recognition (AMR) is critical for cognitive radio,
spectrum monitoring, and secure wireless communication. However, existing
solutions often rely on large labeled datasets or multi-stage training
pipelines, which limit scalability and generalization in practice. We propose a
unified Vision Transformer (ViT) framework that integrates supervised,
self-supervised, and reconstruction objectives. The model combines a ViT
encoder, a lightweight convolutional decoder, and a linear classifier; the
reconstruction branch maps augmented signals back to their originals, anchoring
the encoder to fine-grained I/Q structure. This strategy promotes robust,
discriminative feature learning during pretraining, while partial label
supervision in fine-tuning enables effective classification with limited
labels. On the RML2018.01A dataset, our approach outperforms supervised CNN and
ViT baselines in low-label regimes, approaches ResNet-level accuracy with only
15-20% labeled data, and maintains strong performance across varying SNR
levels. Overall, the framework provides a simple, generalizable, and
label-efficient solution for AMR.

### [5] [InfinityHuman: Towards Long-Term Audio-Driven Human](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20210)
*Xiaodi Li,Pan Xie,Yi Ren,Qijun Gan,Chen Zhang,Fangyuan Kong,Xiang Yin,Bingyue Peng,Zehuan Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InfinityHuman是一个从粗到细的音频驱动人体动画框架，通过姿态引导的细化器和手部特定奖励机制，解决了现有方法中的身份漂移、颜色偏移和手部运动失真问题，实现了高质量、长时长的视频生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 音频驱动人体动画存在生成高分辨率长视频时出现身份漂移、颜色偏移、场景不稳定以及手部运动建模不佳的问题，需要解决这些挑战以实现更自然逼真的动画效果。

Method: 提出coarse-to-fine框架：首先生成音频同步表示，然后使用姿态引导的细化器逐步细化成高分辨率长视频；利用解耦的姿态序列和初始帧作为视觉锚点减少漂移；引入基于高质量手部运动数据训练的手部特定奖励机制。

Result: 在EMTD和HDTF数据集上实现了state-of-the-art性能，在视频质量、身份保持、手部准确性和唇部同步方面表现优异，消融实验验证了各模块的有效性。

Conclusion: InfinityHuman通过稳定的姿态引导和手部奖励机制，有效解决了音频驱动动画中的关键挑战，为生成高质量长时长人体动画提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Audio-driven human animation has attracted wide attention thanks to its
practical applications. However, critical challenges remain in generating
high-resolution, long-duration videos with consistent appearance and natural
hand motions. Existing methods extend videos using overlapping motion frames
but suffer from error accumulation, leading to identity drift, color shifts,
and scene instability. Additionally, hand movements are poorly modeled,
resulting in noticeable distortions and misalignment with the audio. In this
work, we propose InfinityHuman, a coarse-to-fine framework that first generates
audio-synchronized representations, then progressively refines them into
high-resolution, long-duration videos using a pose-guided refiner. Since pose
sequences are decoupled from appearance and resist temporal degradation, our
pose-guided refiner employs stable poses and the initial frame as a visual
anchor to reduce drift and improve lip synchronization. Moreover, to enhance
semantic accuracy and gesture realism, we introduce a hand-specific reward
mechanism trained with high-quality hand motion data. Experiments on the EMTD
and HDTF datasets show that InfinityHuman achieves state-of-the-art performance
in video quality, identity preservation, hand accuracy, and lip-sync. Ablation
studies further confirm the effectiveness of each module. Code will be made
public.

### [6] [Spherical Vision Transformers for Audio-Visual Saliency Prediction in 360-Degree Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20221)
*Mert Cokelek,Halit Ozsoy,Nevrez Imamoglu,Cagri Ozcinar,Inci Ayhan,Erkut Erdem,Aykut Erdem*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究提出了面向360度全景视频的显著性预测模型SalViT360和SalViT360-AV，并创建了包含空间音频的YT360-EyeTracking数据集，显著提升了全景视频中观众注意力预测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有缺乏包含空间音频的360度视听显著性预测数据集，且传统方法难以处理球面畸变和音频整合的复杂性，需要开发新的模型来准确预测全景视频中的视觉显著性。

Method: 提出了两个新颖的显著性预测模型：基于视觉Transformer的SalViT360（具备球面几何感知的时空注意力层）和SalViT360-AV（进一步整合了基于音频输入的Transformer适配器），并创建了包含81个ODV的YT360-EyeTracking数据集。

Result: 在多个基准数据集（包括YT360-EyeTracking）上的实验表明，SalViT360和SalViT360-AV在预测360度场景中观众注意力方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 在模型架构中整合空间音频线索对于准确预测全景视频中的显著性至关重要，音频视觉线索的有效利用能够显著提升360度视频中视觉显著性的预测性能。

Abstract: Omnidirectional videos (ODVs) are redefining viewer experiences in virtual
reality (VR) by offering an unprecedented full field-of-view (FOV). This study
extends the domain of saliency prediction to 360-degree environments,
addressing the complexities of spherical distortion and the integration of
spatial audio. Contextually, ODVs have transformed user experience by adding a
spatial audio dimension that aligns sound direction with the viewer's
perspective in spherical scenes. Motivated by the lack of comprehensive
datasets for 360-degree audio-visual saliency prediction, our study curates
YT360-EyeTracking, a new dataset of 81 ODVs, each observed under varying
audio-visual conditions. Our goal is to explore how to utilize audio-visual
cues to effectively predict visual saliency in 360-degree videos. Towards this
aim, we propose two novel saliency prediction models: SalViT360, a
vision-transformer-based framework for ODVs equipped with spherical
geometry-aware spatio-temporal attention layers, and SalViT360-AV, which
further incorporates transformer adapters conditioned on audio input. Our
results on a number of benchmark datasets, including our YT360-EyeTracking,
demonstrate that SalViT360 and SalViT360-AV significantly outperform existing
methods in predicting viewer attention in 360-degree scenes. Interpreting these
results, we suggest that integrating spatial audio cues in the model
architecture is crucial for accurate saliency prediction in omnidirectional
videos. Code and dataset will be available at
https://cyberiada.github.io/SalViT360.

### [7] [A Novel Framework for Automated Explain Vision Model Using Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20227)
*Phu-Vinh Nguyen,Tan-Hanh Pham,Chris Ngo,Truong Son Hy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于视觉-语言模型的解释性人工智能流水线，用于在样本和数据集层面解释视觉模型的一般行为，发现失败案例并提升模型可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉模型开发主要关注性能指标（如准确率、IoU、mAP），而忽视了可解释性。现有xAI方法多仅解释单个样本，缺乏能够解释模型在大规模数据集上一般行为的方法。理解模型在普通图像上的行为对防止偏见判断和识别模型趋势至关重要。

Method: 提出一种基于视觉-语言模型的流水线方法，能够同时在样本层面和数据集层面解释视觉模型。该流水线可以用最小化的努力发现模型的失败案例并获得深度见解。

Result: 该方法能够有效解释视觉模型的一般行为模式，发现模型的失败情况，并提供有意义的深度见解。

Conclusion: 该研究将视觉模型开发与可解释性分析相结合，提供了一种能够在样本和数据集层面解释模型行为的综合方法，有助于提升图像分析的可解释性和可靠性。

Abstract: The development of many vision models mainly focuses on improving their
performance using metrics such as accuracy, IoU, and mAP, with less attention
to explainability due to the complexity of applying xAI methods to provide a
meaningful explanation of trained models. Although many existing xAI methods
aim to explain vision models sample-by-sample, methods explaining the general
behavior of vision models, which can only be captured after running on a large
dataset, are still underexplored. Furthermore, understanding the behavior of
vision models on general images can be very important to prevent biased
judgments and help identify the model's trends and patterns. With the
application of Vision-Language Models, this paper proposes a pipeline to
explain vision models at both the sample and dataset levels. The proposed
pipeline can be used to discover failure cases and gain insights into vision
models with minimal effort, thereby integrating vision model development with
xAI analysis to advance image analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对农业资源受限环境开发轻量级CNN模型的需求，解决传统知识蒸馏方法在农业计算机视觉应用中的局限性。

Method: 结合自适应温度调度和混合样本增强的知识蒸馏框架，使用MobileNetV3 Large作为教师模型，训练三种不同规模的残差CNN学生模型。

Result: 所有学生模型验证准确率超过96.7%，紧凑模型达到97.11%准确率，比第二名方法提升1.60个百分点，推理延迟仅72.19ms，知识保留率超过99%。

Conclusion: ATMS-KD框架在农业计算机视觉任务中表现出色，能够有效实现知识转移，适合资源受限的农业环境应用。

Abstract: This study proposes ATMS-KD (Adaptive Temperature and Mixed-Sample Knowledge
Distillation), a novel framework for developing lightweight CNN models suitable
for resource-constrained agricultural environments. The framework combines
adaptive temperature scheduling with mixed-sample augmentation to transfer
knowledge from a MobileNetV3 Large teacher model (5.7\,M parameters) to
lightweight residual CNN students. Three student configurations were evaluated:
Compact (1.3\,M parameters), Standard (2.4\,M parameters), and Enhanced (3.8\,M
parameters). The dataset used in this study consists of images of \textit{Rosa
damascena} (Damask rose) collected from agricultural fields in the Dades Oasis,
southeastern Morocco, providing a realistic benchmark for agricultural computer
vision applications under diverse environmental conditions. Experimental
evaluation on the Damascena rose maturity classification dataset demonstrated
significant improvements over direct training methods. All student models
achieved validation accuracies exceeding 96.7\% with ATMS-KD compared to
95--96\% with direct training. The framework outperformed eleven established
knowledge distillation methods, achieving 97.11\% accuracy with the compact
model -- a 1.60 percentage point improvement over the second-best approach
while maintaining the lowest inference latency of 72.19\,ms. Knowledge
retention rates exceeded 99\% for all configurations, demonstrating effective
knowledge transfer regardless of student model capacity.

*Mutahar Safdar,Gentry Wood,Max Zimmermann,Guy Lamouche,Priti Wanjara,Yaoyao Fiona Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的混合视觉-语言表征框架，通过结合深度语义分割和预训练多模态模型，实现了异构微观结构的零样本分类，提高了材料质量评估的效率和可追溯性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决工业制造中高级材料迅速可靠质量评估的瓶颈，特别是对于非传统增材制造过程产生的异构结构。需要将微观结构信息学与专家评估知识相结合，实现更有效的材料质量认证。

Method: 使用定制化的混合视觉-语言表征(VLRs)，集成深度语义分割和预训练多模态模型(CLIP和FLAVA)，将视觉微观数据和文本专家评估编码为共享表征。发展了基于相似性的定制表征，包含专家注释图像的正负参考，通过网状相似性评分实现零样本分类。

Result: 在增材制造金属基复合材料数据集上验证，框架能够区分合格和缺陷样品。FLAVA模型具有更高的视觉敏感性，CLIP模型在文本准则对齐方面更为一致。Z-score标准化格小了数据集驱动的分布差异，提高了混合框架中的对齐和分类效果。

Conclusion: 该方法通过提高原始数据与专家知识之间的语义互操性，为工程信息学领域提供了可扩展和领域适应性更强的质量认证策略，支持人在循环决策而无需任务特定模型重新训练。

Abstract: Rapid and reliable qualification of advanced materials remains a bottleneck
in industrial manufacturing, particularly for heterogeneous structures produced
via non-conventional additive manufacturing processes. This study introduces a
novel framework that links microstructure informatics with a range of expert
characterization knowledge using customized and hybrid vision-language
representations (VLRs). By integrating deep semantic segmentation with
pre-trained multi-modal models (CLIP and FLAVA), we encode both visual
microstructural data and textual expert assessments into shared
representations. To overcome limitations in general-purpose embeddings, we
develop a customized similarity-based representation that incorporates both
positive and negative references from expert-annotated images and their
associated textual descriptions. This allows zero-shot classification of
previously unseen microstructures through a net similarity scoring approach.
Validation on an additively manufactured metal matrix composite dataset
demonstrates the framework's ability to distinguish between acceptable and
defective samples across a range of characterization criteria. Comparative
analysis reveals that FLAVA model offers higher visual sensitivity, while the
CLIP model provides consistent alignment with the textual criteria. Z-score
normalization adjusts raw unimodal and cross-modal similarity scores based on
their local dataset-driven distributions, enabling more effective alignment and
classification in the hybrid vision-language framework. The proposed method
enhances traceability and interpretability in qualification pipelines by
enabling human-in-the-loop decision-making without task-specific model
retraining. By advancing semantic interoperability between raw data and expert
knowledge, this work contributes toward scalable and domain-adaptable
qualification strategies in engineering informatics.

TL;DR: 基于MedNeXt-L-k5模型的自动化轻缩空间分割方法，在T2加权MRI上达到预期互评可靠性相当的性能，但在T1加权MRI和跨数据集情况下性能有所下降


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动分割轻缩空间耗时且互评可靠性中等，现有自动化深度学习模型性能中等且端到端过渡能力不佳

Method: 适配Transformer受启发的3D编码器-解码器卷积神经网络MedNeXt-L-k5，分别在同质性T2加权数据集和异质性T1加权数据集上训练模型

Result: 在HCP-Aging T2加权数据集上达到符合互评可靠性的Dice分数0.88±0.06，但在T1加权数据集上仅为0.58±0.09，跨数据集评估性能更低

Conclusion: MedNeXt-L-k5提供了一种高效的轻缩空间分割方案，但Transformer模型的全局上下文注意机制并非PVS分割的必需特性，本文模型未超过nnU-Net

Abstract: Enlarged perivascular spaces (PVS) are increasingly recognized as biomarkers
of cerebral small vessel disease, Alzheimer's disease, stroke, and
aging-related neurodegeneration. However, manual segmentation of PVS is
time-consuming and subject to moderate inter-rater reliability, while existing
automated deep learning models have moderate performance and typically fail to
generalize across diverse clinical and research MRI datasets. We adapted
MedNeXt-L-k5, a Transformer-inspired 3D encoder-decoder convolutional network,
for automated PVS segmentation. Two models were trained: one using a
homogeneous dataset of 200 T2-weighted (T2w) MRI scans from the Human
Connectome Project-Aging (HCP-Aging) dataset and another using 40 heterogeneous
T1-weighted (T1w) MRI volumes from seven studies across six scanners. Model
performance was evaluated using internal 5-fold cross validation (5FCV) and
leave-one-site-out cross validation (LOSOCV). MedNeXt-L-k5 models trained on
the T2w images of the HCP-Aging dataset achieved voxel-level Dice scores of
0.88+/-0.06 (white matter, WM), comparable to the reported inter-rater
reliability of that dataset, and the highest yet reported in the literature.
The same models trained on the T1w images of the HCP-Aging dataset achieved a
substantially lower Dice score of 0.58+/-0.09 (WM). Under LOSOCV, the model had
voxel-level Dice scores of 0.38+/-0.16 (WM) and 0.35+/-0.12 (BG), and
cluster-level Dice scores of 0.61+/-0.19 (WM) and 0.62+/-0.21 (BG).
MedNeXt-L-k5 provides an efficient solution for automated PVS segmentation
across diverse T1w and T2w MRI datasets. MedNeXt-L-k5 did not outperform the
nnU-Net, indicating that the attention-based mechanisms present in
transformer-inspired models to provide global context are not required for high
accuracy in PVS segmentation.

*Zhixiang Chi,Yanan Wu,Li Gu,Huan Liu,Ziqiang Wang,Yang Zhang,Yang Wang,Konstantinos N. Plataniotis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种无需训练的反馈驱动自适应框架，通过将输出层的片形对应关系适应到中间注意力机制，以解决CLIP在开攻词分割中的定位问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP虽然具有强大的视觉-文本对齐能力，但在开攻词分割任务中因为定位能力较差而表现不佳。之前的方法通过修改中间注意力来提升空间一致性，但由于后续操作的影响，这种一致性无法一致传播到最终输出。

Method: 设计了一个包含关键模块的反馈驱动框架：注意力隔离、基于信心度的剪枝稀疏适应、适应集成。将模型输出作为更强的空间一致性先验知识，适应到中间注意力机制。

Result: 方法作为插入模块无缝集成到4种最先进方法和3种背骨网络（ViT-B, ViT-L, ViT-H）。在8个标准数据集上一致提升了性能，支持多种注意力类型。

Conclusion: 该框架通过将最终输出的空间一致性反馈到中间表征，有效提升了CLIP在开攻词分割任务中的表现，为解决中间表征与最终预测之间的语义不一致性提供了有效方案。

Abstract: CLIP exhibits strong visual-textual alignment but struggle with
open-vocabulary segmentation due to poor localization. Prior methods enhance
spatial coherence by modifying intermediate attention. But, this coherence
isn't consistently propagated to the final output due to subsequent operations
such as projections. Additionally, intermediate attention lacks direct
interaction with text representations, such semantic discrepancy limits the
full potential of CLIP.
  In this work, we propose a training-free, feedback-driven self-adaptive
framework that adapts output-based patch-level correspondences back to the
intermediate attention. The output predictions, being the culmination of the
model's processing, encapsulate the most comprehensive visual and textual
semantics about each patch. Our approach enhances semantic consistency between
internal representations and final predictions by leveraging the model's
outputs as a stronger spatial coherence prior. We design key modules, including
attention isolation, confidence-based pruning for sparse adaptation, and
adaptation ensemble, to effectively feedback the output coherence cues. Our
method functions as a plug-in module, seamlessly integrating into four
state-of-the-art approaches with three backbones (ViT-B, ViT-L, ViT-H). We
further validate our framework across multiple attention types (Q-K, self-self,
and Proxy augmented with MAE, SAM, and DINO). Our approach consistently
improves their performance across eight benchmarks.

*Zhuoran Yu,Yong Jae Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个探测框架来系统分析多模态大语言模型在不同层次处理视觉和文本输入的动态过程，发现了模型具有一致的阶段性结构：早期层进行视觉基础处理，中间层支持词汇整合和语义推理，最后层准备任务特定输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视觉语言任务上表现出色，但其内部处理机制尚未得到充分探索，需要系统分析模型如何处理视觉和文本输入。

Method: 训练线性分类器从各层token嵌入中预测细粒度视觉类别，使用标准化锚点问题，并在三种提示变体下评估：词汇变体、语义否定变体和输出格式变体。

Result: 在LLaVA-1.5、LLaVA-Next-LLaMA-3和Qwen2-VL模型中发现一致的阶段性结构，整体结构在不同视觉分词、指令调优数据和预训练语料下保持稳定，但具体层次分配随基础LLM架构变化而显著调整。

Conclusion: 研究提供了对MLLM层次组织结构的统一视角，并提供了轻量级、模型无关的方法来分析多模态表示动态。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong performance
across a wide range of vision-language tasks, yet their internal processing
dynamics remain underexplored. In this work, we introduce a probing framework
to systematically analyze how MLLMs process visual and textual inputs across
layers. We train linear classifiers to predict fine-grained visual categories
(e.g., dog breeds) from token embeddings extracted at each layer, using a
standardized anchor question. To uncover the functional roles of different
layers, we evaluate these probes under three types of controlled prompt
variations: (1) lexical variants that test sensitivity to surface-level
changes, (2) semantic negation variants that flip the expected answer by
modifying the visual concept in the prompt, and (3) output format variants that
preserve reasoning but alter the answer format. Applying our framework to
LLaVA-1.5, LLaVA-Next-LLaMA-3, and Qwen2-VL, we identify a consistent
stage-wise structure in which early layers perform visual grounding, middle
layers support lexical integration and semantic reasoning, and final layers
prepare task-specific outputs. We further show that while the overall
stage-wise structure remains stable across variations in visual tokenization,
instruction tuning data, and pretraining corpus, the specific layer allocation
to each stage shifts notably with changes in the base LLM architecture. Our
findings provide a unified perspective on the layer-wise organization of MLLMs
and offer a lightweight, model-agnostic approach for analyzing multimodal

TL;DR: 提出SLiCS方法，通过监督字典学习将视觉-语言共嵌入空间分解为概念特定的线性子空间，实现更精确的概念过滤图像检索和条件生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 假设CLIP等视觉-语言共嵌入空间可以解耦，将复杂场景的内容信息分解到不同的概念特定子空间中，以提升下游任务的精确度。

Method: 采用监督字典学习方法，估计线性合成模型，通过稀疏非负组合和分组向量字典，使用新颖的交替优化算法保证收敛。

Result: SLiCS提供的解耦嵌入能够实现更精确的概念过滤图像检索，在TiTok和DINOv2等多种嵌入上都显示出改进的检索精度。

Conclusion: 稀疏线性概念子空间方法有效解耦了视觉-语言嵌入空间，为概念级别的图像检索和生成任务提供了更精确的工具。

Abstract: Vision-language co-embedding networks, such as CLIP, provide a latent
embedding space with semantic information that is useful for downstream tasks.
We hypothesize that the embedding space can be disentangled to separate the
information on the content of complex scenes by decomposing the embedding into
multiple concept-specific component vectors that lie in different subspaces. We
propose a supervised dictionary learning approach to estimate a linear
synthesis model consisting of sparse, non-negative combinations of groups of
vectors in the dictionary (atoms), whose group-wise activity matches the
multi-label information. Each concept-specific component is a non-negative
combination of atoms associated to a label. The group-structured dictionary is
optimized through a novel alternating optimization with guaranteed convergence.
Exploiting the text co-embeddings, we detail how semantically meaningful
descriptions can be found based on text embeddings of words best approximated
by a concept's group of atoms, and unsupervised dictionary learning can exploit
zero-shot classification of training set images using the text embeddings of
concept labels to provide instance-wise multi-labels. We show that the
disentangled embeddings provided by our sparse linear concept subspaces (SLiCS)
enable concept-filtered image retrieval (and conditional generation using
image-to-prompt) that is more precise. We also apply SLiCS to highly-compressed
autoencoder embeddings from TiTok and the latent embedding from self-supervised
DINOv2. Quantitative and qualitative results highlight the improved precision
of the concept-filtered image retrieval for all embeddings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedFoundationHub是一个图形化工具包，旨在安全部署医疗视觉语言模型，解决PHI泄露等安全风险，支持医生无需编程即可使用不同模型，并通过专家评估揭示了当前模型的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗视觉语言模型在临床应用中存在严重的安全隐患，特别是受保护健康信息(PHI)泄露、数据泄漏和网络威胁风险，需要开发安全可靠的部署工具。

Method: 开发了MedFoundationHub GUI工具包，支持医生手动选择模型无需编程，工程师可插件式部署Hugging Face开源模型，通过Docker编排实现隐私保护推理，仅需单块NVIDIA A6000 GPU的本地工作站。

Result: 邀请认证病理学家部署评估5个先进VLM模型，在结肠和肾脏病例上进行1015次临床医生-模型评分，发现模型存在回答偏离目标、推理模糊和病理术语不一致等重复性局限。

Conclusion: MedFoundationHub提供了安全可访问的医疗VLM部署解决方案，但当前模型仍存在显著局限性，需要进一步改进以确保临床应用的可靠性和安全性。

Abstract: Recent advances in medical vision-language models (VLMs) open up remarkable
opportunities for clinical applications such as automated report generation,
copilots for physicians, and uncertainty quantification. However, despite their
promise, medical VLMs introduce serious security concerns, most notably risks
of Protected Health Information (PHI) exposure, data leakage, and vulnerability
to cyberthreats - which are especially critical in hospital environments. Even
when adopted for research or non-clinical purposes, healthcare organizations
must exercise caution and implement safeguards. To address these challenges, we
present MedFoundationHub, a graphical user interface (GUI) toolkit that: (1)
enables physicians to manually select and use different models without
programming expertise, (2) supports engineers in efficiently deploying medical
VLMs in a plug-and-play fashion, with seamless integration of Hugging Face
open-source models, and (3) ensures privacy-preserving inference through
Docker-orchestrated, operating system agnostic deployment. MedFoundationHub
requires only an offline local workstation equipped with a single NVIDIA A6000
GPU, making it both secure and accessible within the typical resources of
academic research labs. To evaluate current capabilities, we engaged
board-certified pathologists to deploy and assess five state-of-the-art VLMs
(Google-MedGemma3-4B, Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, and
LLaVA-1.5-7B/13B). Expert evaluation covered colon cases and renal cases,
yielding 1015 clinician-model scoring events. These assessments revealed
recurring limitations, including off-target answers, vague reasoning, and
inconsistent pathology terminology.

TL;DR: 提出了双向交互Mamba（BIM）模型，通过新颖的扫描机制解决多任务密集预测中交叉任务交互与计算效率的权衡问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多任务密集预测中充分的跨任务交互对成功至关重要，但现有方法面临交互完整性与计算效率之间的权衡限制

Method: 引入双向交互扫描（BI-Scan）机制构建任务特定表示作为双向序列，结合任务优先和位置优先扫描模式；采用多尺度扫描（MS-Scan）机制实现多粒度场景建模

Result: 在NYUD-V2和PASCAL-Context两个基准测试上表现出优于最先进竞争方法的性能

Conclusion: BIM模型通过创新的扫描机制有效解决了多任务密集预测中的交互效率问题，在保持线性复杂度的同时实现了充分的跨任务信息交互

Abstract: Sufficient cross-task interaction is crucial for success in multi-task dense
prediction. However, sufficient interaction often results in high computational
complexity, forcing existing methods to face the trade-off between interaction
completeness and computational efficiency. To address this limitation, this
work proposes a Bidirectional Interaction Mamba (BIM), which incorporates novel
scanning mechanisms to adapt the Mamba modeling approach for multi-task dense
prediction. On the one hand, we introduce a novel Bidirectional Interaction
Scan (BI-Scan) mechanism, which constructs task-specific representations as
bidirectional sequences during interaction. By integrating task-first and
position-first scanning modes within a unified linear complexity architecture,
BI-Scan efficiently preserves critical cross-task information. On the other
hand, we employ a Multi-Scale Scan~(MS-Scan) mechanism to achieve
multi-granularity scene modeling. This design not only meets the diverse
granularity requirements of various tasks but also enhances nuanced cross-task
feature interactions. Extensive experiments on two challenging benchmarks,
\emph{i.e.}, NYUD-V2 and PASCAL-Context, show the superiority of our BIM vs its
state-of-the-art competitors.

TL;DR: 一种新的音频导航视觉编辑框架，通过多模态编码器和噪声分支技术，在不需额外训练的情况下处理复杂的多模态编辑任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本导向编辑方法在复杂场景中存在限制，需要额外的非文本编辑提示，而现有音频导航方法通常需要特定数据集训练以对齐音频与文本。

Method: 利用预训练多模态编码器的零样本能力，通过减少音频编码器空间与扩散模型提示编码器空间的差异，并采用分离噪声分支和适配性片选择来处理多模态编辑提示。

Result: 在多样化编辑任务上的综合实验表明，该框架能够通过涉及丰富音频信息来处理复杂编辑场景，而仅依靠文本的方法无法完成。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种无需额外训练的音频导航视觉编辑框架，能够有效处理复杂的多模态编辑任务，为多模态编辑领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Visual editing with diffusion models has made significant progress but often
struggles with complex scenarios that textual guidance alone could not
adequately describe, highlighting the need for additional non-text editing
prompts. In this work, we introduce a novel audio-guided visual editing
framework that can handle complex editing tasks with multiple text and audio
prompts without requiring additional training. Existing audio-guided visual
editing methods often necessitate training on specific datasets to align audio
with text, limiting their generalization to real-world situations. We leverage
a pre-trained multi-modal encoder with strong zero-shot capabilities and
integrate diverse audio into visual editing tasks, by alleviating the
discrepancy between the audio encoder space and the diffusion model's prompt
encoder space. Additionally, we propose a novel approach to handle complex
scenarios with multiple and multi-modal editing prompts through our separate
noise branching and adaptive patch selection. Our comprehensive experiments on
diverse editing tasks demonstrate that our framework excels in handling
complicated editing scenarios by incorporating rich information from audio,
where text-only approaches fail.

Motivation: 因为完全注释大规模多标签数据集成本高、耗时。传统SPML方法将缺失标签视为负样本导致错误，而各种伪标签策略又会带来噪音

Method: 提出GPR损失函数，能够从多样化伪标签中有效学习并减少噪音；以及DAMP动态增强多焦点伪标签技术，构成AEVLP框架

Result: 在四个标准数据集上进行了涉幅实验，证明该框架显著提升了多标签分类性能，达到了最先进水平

Conclusion: AEVLP框架通过GPR损失函数和DAMP技术，有效解决了单正样本多标签学习中的噪音问题，为部分注释数据学习提供了有效方案

Abstract: Multi-label learning is a challenging computer vision task that requires
assigning multiple categories to each image. However, fully annotating
large-scale datasets is often impractical due to high costs and effort,
motivating the study of learning from partially annotated data. In the extreme
case of Single Positive Multi-Label Learning (SPML), each image is provided
with only one positive label, while all other labels remain unannotated.
Traditional SPML methods that treat missing labels as unknown or negative tend
to yield inaccuracies and false negatives, and integrating various
pseudo-labeling strategies can introduce additional noise. To address these
challenges, we propose the Generalized Pseudo-Label Robust Loss (GPR Loss), a
novel loss function that effectively learns from diverse pseudo-labels while
mitigating noise. Complementing this, we introduce a simple yet effective
Dynamic Augmented Multi-focus Pseudo-labeling (DAMP) technique. Together, these
contributions form the Adaptive and Efficient Vision-Language Pseudo-Labeling
(AEVLP) framework. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate
that our framework significantly advances multi-label classification, achieving
state-of-the-art results.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出延迟脉冲方法和时间依赖的积分发放(tdIF)神经元架构，解决SNN在视觉检测任务中性能不佳的问题，在超低时间步长(5步内)下实现最先进的检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前ANN-SNN转换方法在分类任务中表现优异，但在视觉检测任务中性能仍然不理想，主要存在异质脉冲模式导致的残余膜电位问题。

Method: 1. 延迟脉冲方法缓解异质脉冲模式引起的残余膜电位问题；2. 提出tdIF神经元架构，使IF神经元能够根据时间步长的时序动态调整积累和发放行为；3. 让脉冲表现出不同的时间特性，而非仅依赖频率表示。

Result: 在目标检测和车道线检测两个关键视觉任务上进行了广泛评估，方法超越了当前ANN-SNN转换方法，在超低延迟(5个时间步内)下实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: tdIF方法能够以更低的时间步长实现更精确的特征表示，在保持与传统IF神经元相当能耗的同时，实现了高性能和超低延迟的视觉检测任务。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), inspired by the brain, are characterized by
minimal power consumption and swift inference capabilities on neuromorphic
hardware, and have been widely applied to various visual perception tasks.
Current ANN-SNN conversion methods have achieved excellent results in
classification tasks with ultra-low time-steps, but their performance in visual
detection tasks remains suboptimal. In this paper, we propose a delay-spike
approach to mitigate the issue of residual membrane potential caused by
heterogeneous spiking patterns. Furthermore, we propose a novel
temporal-dependent Integrate-and-Fire (tdIF) neuron architecture for SNNs. This
enables Integrate-and-fire (IF) neurons to dynamically adjust their
accumulation and firing behaviors based on the temporal order of time-steps.
Our method enables spikes to exhibit distinct temporal properties, rather than
relying solely on frequency-based representations. Moreover, the tdIF neuron
maintains energy consumption on par with traditional IF neuron. We demonstrate
that our method achieves more precise feature representation with lower
time-steps, enabling high performance and ultra-low latency in visual detection
tasks. In this study, we conduct extensive evaluation of the tdIF method across
two critical vision tasks: object detection and lane line detection. The
results demonstrate that the proposed method surpasses current ANN-SNN
conversion approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance with ultra-low
latency (within 5 time-steps).

*Yuqi Xiong,Wuzhen Shi,Yang Wen,Ruhan Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出DUP-MCRNet网络，通过动态不确定性传播和多模态协同推理解决显著目标检测中的细节丢失、边缘模糊和模态信息融合不足问题，在多个基准数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有显著目标检测方法在复杂场景中容易丢失细节、模糊边缘，且单模态信息融合不足，需要提升对复杂背景的鲁棒性和边缘清晰度。

Method: 设计动态不确定性图卷积模块(DUGC)通过空间语义距离构建稀疏图传播不确定性；提出多模态协同融合策略(MCF)使用可学习模态门控权重融合RGB、深度和边缘特征；采用多尺度BCE和IoU损失、跨尺度一致性约束和不确定性引导监督机制优化检测性能。

Result: 在大多数常见基准数据集上优于各种SOD方法，特别是在边缘清晰度和对复杂背景的鲁棒性方面表现突出。

Conclusion: DUP-MCRNet通过动态不确定性传播和多模态协同融合有效提升了显著目标检测的精度和鲁棒性，特别是在处理复杂场景和小结构检测方面具有优势。

Abstract: In view of the problems that existing salient object detection (SOD) methods
are prone to losing details, blurring edges, and insufficient fusion of
single-modal information in complex scenes, this paper proposes a dynamic
uncertainty propagation and multimodal collaborative reasoning network
(DUP-MCRNet). Firstly, a dynamic uncertainty graph convolution module (DUGC) is
designed to propagate uncertainty between layers through a sparse graph
constructed based on spatial semantic distance, and combined with channel
adaptive interaction, it effectively improves the detection accuracy of small
structures and edge regions. Secondly, a multimodal collaborative fusion
strategy (MCF) is proposed, which uses learnable modality gating weights to
weightedly fuse the attention maps of RGB, depth, and edge features. It can
dynamically adjust the importance of each modality according to different
scenes, effectively suppress redundant or interfering information, and
strengthen the semantic complementarity and consistency between
cross-modalities, thereby improving the ability to identify salient regions
under occlusion, weak texture or background interference. Finally, the
detection performance at the pixel level and region level is optimized through
multi-scale BCE and IoU loss, cross-scale consistency constraints, and
uncertainty-guided supervision mechanisms. Extensive experiments show that
DUP-MCRNet outperforms various SOD methods on most common benchmark datasets,
especially in terms of edge clarity and robustness to complex backgrounds. Our
code is publicly available at https://github.com/YukiBear426/DUP-MCRNet.

Conclusion: MSMVD方法通过多尺度BEV特征的生成和综合，有效解决了多视角行人检测中的尺度差异问题，显著提高了检测精度

Abstract: Multi-View Pedestrian Detection (MVPD) aims to detect pedestrians in the form
of a bird's eye view (BEV) from multi-view images. In MVPD, end-to-end
trainable deep learning methods have progressed greatly. However, they often
struggle to detect pedestrians with consistently small or large scales in views
or with vastly different scales between views. This is because they do not
exploit multi-scale image features to generate the BEV feature and detect
pedestrians. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel MVPD method, called
Multi-Scale Multi-View Detection (MSMVD). MSMVD generates multi-scale BEV
features by projecting multi-scale image features extracted from individual
views into the BEV space, scale-by-scale. Each of these BEV features inherits
the properties of its corresponding scale image features from multiple views.
Therefore, these BEV features help the precise detection of pedestrians with
consistently small or large scales in views. Then, MSMVD combines information
at different scales of multiple views by processing the multi-scale BEV
features using a feature pyramid network. This improves the detection of
pedestrians with vastly different scales between views. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that exploiting multi-scale image features via multi-scale BEV
features greatly improves the detection performance, and MSMVD outperforms the
previous highest MODA by $4.5$ points on the GMVD dataset.

Abstract: Focusing on the development of an end-to-end autonomous vehicle model with
pixel-to-pixel context awareness, this research proposes the SKGE-Swin
architecture. This architecture utilizes the Swin Transformer with a skip-stage
mechanism to broaden feature representation globally and at various network
levels. This approach enables the model to extract information from distant
pixels by leveraging the Swin Transformer's Shifted Window-based Multi-head
Self-Attention (SW-MSA) mechanism and to retain critical information from the
initial to the final stages of feature extraction, thereby enhancing its
capability to comprehend complex patterns in the vehicle's surroundings. The
model is evaluated on the CARLA platform using adversarial scenarios to
simulate real-world conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that the
SKGE-Swin architecture achieves a superior Driving Score compared to previous
methods. Furthermore, an ablation study will be conducted to evaluate the
contribution of each architectural component, including the influence of skip
connections and the use of the Swin Transformer, in improving model
performance.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of real-time deepfake generation techniques,
forged content is becoming increasingly realistic and widespread across
applications like video conferencing and social media. Although
state-of-the-art detectors achieve high accuracy on standard benchmarks, their
heavy computational cost hinders real-time deployment in practical
applications. To address this, we propose the Spatial-Frequency Aware
Multi-Scale Fusion Network (SFMFNet), a lightweight yet effective architecture
for real-time deepfake detection. We design a spatial-frequency hybrid aware
module that jointly leverages spatial textures and frequency artifacts through
a gated mechanism, enhancing sensitivity to subtle manipulations. A
token-selective cross attention mechanism enables efficient multi-level feature
interaction, while a residual-enhanced blur pooling structure helps retain key
semantic cues during downsampling. Experiments on several benchmark datasets
show that SFMFNet achieves a favorable balance between accuracy and efficiency,
with strong generalization and practical value for real-time applications.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicle perception typically relies on modular pipelines that
decompose the task into detection, tracking, and prediction. While
interpretable, these pipelines suffer from error accumulation and limited
inter-task synergy. Unified perception has emerged as a promising paradigm that
integrates these sub-tasks within a shared architecture, potentially improving
robustness, contextual reasoning, and efficiency while retaining interpretable
outputs. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of unified
perception, introducing a holistic and systemic taxonomy that categorizes
methods along task integration, tracking formulation, and representation flow.
We define three paradigms -Early, Late, and Full Unified Perception- and
systematically review existing methods, their architectures, training
strategies, datasets used, and open-source availability, while highlighting
future research directions. This work establishes the first comprehensive
framework for understanding and advancing unified perception, consolidates
fragmented efforts, and guides future research toward more robust,
generalizable, and interpretable perception.

Abstract: We propose a novel medical image classification method that integrates
dual-model weight selection with self-knowledge distillation (SKD). In
real-world medical settings, deploying large-scale models is often limited by
computational resource constraints, which pose significant challenges for their
practical implementation. Thus, developing lightweight models that achieve
comparable performance to large-scale models while maintaining computational
efficiency is crucial. To address this, we employ a dual-model weight selection
strategy that initializes two lightweight models with weights derived from a
large pretrained model, enabling effective knowledge transfer. Next, SKD is
applied to these selected models, allowing the use of a broad range of initial
weight configurations without imposing additional excessive computational cost,
followed by fine-tuning for the target classification tasks. By combining
dual-model weight selection with self-knowledge distillation, our method
overcomes the limitations of conventional approaches, which often fail to
retain critical information in compact models. Extensive experiments on
publicly available datasets-chest X-ray images, lung computed tomography scans,
and brain magnetic resonance imaging scans-demonstrate the superior performance
and robustness of our approach compared to existing methods.

Abstract: In the era of Industry 5.0, monitoring human activity is essential for
ensuring both ergonomic safety and overall well-being. While multi-camera
centralized setups improve pose estimation accuracy, they often suffer from
high computational costs and bandwidth requirements, limiting scalability and
real-time applicability. Distributing processing across edge devices can reduce
network bandwidth and computational load. On the other hand, the constrained
resources of edge devices lead to accuracy degradation, and the distribution of
computation leads to temporal and spatial inconsistencies. We address this
challenge by proposing COMETH (Convex Optimization for Multiview Estimation and
Tracking of Humans), a lightweight algorithm for real-time multi-view human
pose fusion that relies on three concepts: it integrates kinematic and
biomechanical constraints to increase the joint positioning accuracy; it
employs convex optimization-based inverse kinematics for spatial fusion; and it
implements a state observer to improve temporal consistency. We evaluate COMETH
on both public and industrial datasets, where it outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in localization, detection, and tracking accuracy. The proposed fusion
pipeline enables accurate and scalable human motion tracking, making it
well-suited for industrial and safety-critical applications. The code is

Existing methods typically convert unordered points into hierarchical octree or
voxel structures for dense-to-sparse predictive coding. However, the extreme
sparsity of geometric details hinders efficient context modeling, thereby
limiting their compression performance and speed. To address this challenge, we
propose to generate compact features for efficient predictive coding. Our
framework comprises two lightweight modules. First, the Geometry
Re-Densification Module re-densifies encoded sparse geometry, extracts features
at denser scale, and then re-sparsifies the features for predictive coding.
This module avoids costly computation on highly sparse details while
maintaining a lightweight prediction head. Second, the Cross-scale Feature
Propagation Module leverages occupancy cues from multiple resolution levels to
guide hierarchical feature propagation. This design facilitates information
sharing across scales, thereby reducing redundant feature extraction and
providing enriched features for the Geometry Re-Densification Module. By
integrating these two modules, our method yields a compact feature
representation that provides efficient context modeling and accelerates the
coding process. Experiments on the KITTI dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art
compression ratios and real-time performance, achieving 26 FPS for both
encoding and decoding at 12-bit quantization. Code is available at

Abstract: Scaling laws have validated the success and promise of large-data-trained
models in creative generation across text, image, and video domains. However,
this paradigm faces data scarcity in the 3D domain, as there is far less of it
available on the internet compared to the aforementioned modalities.
Fortunately, there exist adequate videos that inherently contain commonsense
priors, offering an alternative supervisory signal to mitigate the
generalization bottleneck caused by limited native 3D data. On the one hand,
videos capturing multiple views of an object or scene provide a spatial
consistency prior for 3D generation. On the other hand, the rich semantic
information contained within the videos enables the generated content to be
more faithful to the text prompts and semantically plausible. This paper
explores how to apply the video modality in 3D asset generation, spanning
datasets to models. We introduce Droplet3D-4M, the first large-scale video
dataset with multi-view level annotations, and train Droplet3D, a generative
model supporting both image and dense text input. Extensive experiments
validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating its ability to
produce spatially consistent and semantically plausible content. Moreover, in
contrast to the prevailing 3D solutions, our approach exhibits the potential
for extension to scene-level applications. This indicates that the commonsense
priors from the videos significantly facilitate 3D creation. We have
open-sourced all resources including the dataset, code, technical framework,
and model weights: https://dropletx.github.io/.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CogVLA是一个认知对齐的视觉-语言-动作框架，通过指令驱动路由和稀疏化技术，在提高效率的同时提升性能，相比OpenVLA减少2.5倍训练成本和2.8倍推理延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的VLA模型需要大量后训练，计算开销大，限制了可扩展性和部署。受人类多模态协调启发，需要更高效的框架。

Method: 采用3阶段渐进架构：1) EFA-Routing注入指令信息选择性地聚合压缩视觉token；2) LFP-Routing通过剪枝实现token级稀疏化；3) V-L-A耦合注意力机制确保压缩感知输入仍能支持准确动作生成。

Result: 在LIBERO基准测试和真实机器人任务中分别达到97.4%和70.0%的成功率，实现最先进性能。

Conclusion: CogVLA通过认知对齐设计显著提高了VLA模型的效率和性能，为实际部署提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models built on pre-trained
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) require extensive post-training, resulting in
high computational overhead that limits scalability and deployment.We propose
CogVLA, a Cognition-Aligned Vision-Language-Action framework that leverages
instruction-driven routing and sparsification to improve both efficiency and
performance. CogVLA draws inspiration from human multimodal coordination and
introduces a 3-stage progressive architecture. 1) Encoder-FiLM based
Aggregation Routing (EFA-Routing) injects instruction information into the
vision encoder to selectively aggregate and compress dual-stream visual tokens,
forming a instruction-aware latent representation. 2) Building upon this
compact visual encoding, LLM-FiLM based Pruning Routing (LFP-Routing)
introduces action intent into the language model by pruning
instruction-irrelevant visually grounded tokens, thereby achieving token-level
sparsity. 3) To ensure that compressed perception inputs can still support
accurate and coherent action generation, we introduce V-L-A Coupled Attention
(CAtten), which combines causal vision-language attention with bidirectional
action parallel decoding. Extensive experiments on the LIBERO benchmark and
real-world robotic tasks demonstrate that CogVLA achieves state-of-the-art
performance with success rates of 97.4% and 70.0%, respectively, while reducing
training costs by 2.5-fold and decreasing inference latency by 2.8-fold
compared to OpenVLA. CogVLA is open-sourced and publicly available at

Motivation: 自动驾驶系统需要大量corner cases进行训练验证，但真实世界收集成本高且危险。现有3D高斯溅射和图像生成方法存在视觉保真度有限和姿态控制不精确的问题

Method: 利用编辑对象的3D高斯表示作为密集先验注入去噪过程，采用场景级3D边界框布局重建非目标对象的遮挡区域，并融入层次化细粒度特征指导外观细节

Result: 在Waymo Open Dataset上有效支持物体重新定位、插入和删除，在姿态可控性和视觉质量方面优于现有方法，并有益于下游数据驱动任务

Conclusion: G^2Editor提供了一个统一框架，能够生成逼真且精确控制的驾驶场景编辑，为自动驾驶系统提供了高质量的训练数据生成解决方案

Abstract: Corner cases are crucial for training and validating autonomous driving
systems, yet collecting them from the real world is often costly and hazardous.
Editing objects within captured sensor data offers an effective alternative for
generating diverse scenarios, commonly achieved through 3D Gaussian Splatting
or image generative models. However, these approaches often suffer from limited
visual fidelity or imprecise pose control. To address these issues, we propose
G^2Editor, a framework designed for photorealistic and precise object editing
in driving videos. Our method leverages a 3D Gaussian representation of the
edited object as a dense prior, injected into the denoising process to ensure
accurate pose control and spatial consistency. A scene-level 3D bounding box
layout is employed to reconstruct occluded areas of non-target objects.
Furthermore, to guide the appearance details of the edited object, we
incorporate hierarchical fine-grained features as additional conditions during
generation. Experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset demonstrate that G^2Editor
effectively supports object repositioning, insertion, and deletion within a
unified framework, outperforming existing methods in both pose controllability
and visual quality, while also benefiting downstream data-driven tasks.

Motivation: 肾美体发育不良(CCD)等稀缺病理情况导致注释数据极其稀缺，使得深度学习模型难以泛化，影响胲胎脑部分割的准确性和临床应用。

Method: 提出病理知识领域随机化策略，将CCD表现的先验知识嵌入合成数据生成流程，仅使用健康数据模拟多样化的脑部变异。

Result: 在321例胲儿数据集上验证，在CCD病例中显著提升性能，肾美体长度估计误差从10.9mm降至0.7mm，同时保持对健康和其他病理的分割性能。获得更好的拓扑一致性。

Conclusion: 将领域特定的解剖先验知识集成到合成数据流程中，可有效缓解数据稀缺问题，提升对稀缺但临床重要病变的分析能力。

Abstract: Accurate fetal brain segmentation is crucial for extracting biomarkers and
assessing neurodevelopment, especially in conditions such as corpus callosum
dysgenesis (CCD), which can induce drastic anatomical changes. However, the
rarity of CCD severely limits annotated data, hindering the generalization of
deep learning models. To address this, we propose a pathology-informed domain
randomization strategy that embeds prior knowledge of CCD manifestations into a
synthetic data generation pipeline. By simulating diverse brain alterations
from healthy data alone, our approach enables robust segmentation without
requiring pathological annotations.
  We validate our method on a cohort comprising 248 healthy fetuses, 26 with
CCD, and 47 with other brain pathologies, achieving substantial improvements on
CCD cases while maintaining performance on both healthy fetuses and those with
other pathologies. From the predicted segmentations, we derive clinically
relevant biomarkers, such as corpus callosum length (LCC) and volume, and show
their utility in distinguishing CCD subtypes. Our pathology-informed
augmentation reduces the LCC estimation error from 1.89 mm to 0.80 mm in
healthy cases and from 10.9 mm to 0.7 mm in CCD cases. Beyond these
quantitative gains, our approach yields segmentations with improved topological
consistency relative to available ground truth, enabling more reliable
shape-based analyses. Overall, this work demonstrates that incorporating
domain-specific anatomical priors into synthetic data pipelines can effectively
mitigate data scarcity and enhance analysis of rare but clinically significant
malformations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语音识别系统对聋听障碍人士不友好，而视觉交流方式如手语和唇读通常被单独研究，缺乏统一框架整合。

Method: 设计了一个统一的多模态无关结构，能够有效处理异构输入，并深入探索模态间的协同作用，特别是唇部动作在手语理解中的作用。

Result: 在SLT、VSR、ASR和AVSR任务上达到或超过了专门模型的最新性能水平，并发现显式建模唇部动作作为独立模态能显著提升手语翻译效果。

Conclusion: 该统一框架成功整合了多种视觉音频模态，为聋听障碍人士提供了更全面的通信解决方案，并为多模态交互研究开启了新方向。

Abstract: Audio is the primary modality for human communication and has driven the
success of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technologies. However, such
systems remain inherently inaccessible to individuals who are deaf or hard of
hearing. Visual alternatives such as sign language and lip reading offer
effective substitutes, and recent advances in Sign Language Translation (SLT)
and Visual Speech Recognition (VSR) have improved audio-less communication.
Yet, these modalities have largely been studied in isolation, and their
integration within a unified framework remains underexplored. In this paper, we
introduce the first unified framework capable of handling diverse combinations
of sign language, lip movements, and audio for spoken-language text generation.
We focus on three main objectives: (i) designing a unified, modality-agnostic
architecture capable of effectively processing heterogeneous inputs; (ii)
exploring the underexamined synergy among modalities, particularly the role of
lip movements as non-manual cues in sign language comprehension; and (iii)
achieving performance on par with or superior to state-of-the-art models
specialized for individual tasks. Building on this framework, we achieve
performance on par with or better than task-specific state-of-the-art models
across SLT, VSR, ASR, and AVSR. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that
explicitly modeling lip movements as a separate modality significantly improves
SLT performance.

Motivation: 长视频理解面临长程时间依赖和多个事件的挑战，现有方法依赖静态推理或外部视觉语言模型，存在复杂性和端到端训练不足导致的性能次优问题。

Method: 提出多轮推理框架，逐步选择视频片段并基于先前处理片段的理解进行迭代推理；引入门控双层次奖励系统，结合轨迹级奖励（答案正确性）和轮次级奖励（帧-查询相关性）。

Result: 在VideoMME、MLVU和EgoSchema等基准测试中，Video-MTR在准确性和效率方面均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Video-MTR通过端到端训练和迭代推理机制，显著提升了长视频理解的性能，无需外部视觉语言模型，推动了该领域的技术发展。

Abstract: Long-form video understanding, characterized by long-range temporal
dependencies and multiple events, remains a challenge. Existing methods often
rely on static reasoning or external visual-language models (VLMs), which face
issues like complexity and sub-optimal performance due to the lack of
end-to-end training. In this paper, we propose Video-MTR, a reinforced
multi-turn reasoning framework designed to enable iterative key video segment
selection and question comprehension. Unlike traditional video reasoning
pipeline, which generate predictions in a single turn, Video-MTR performs
reasoning in multiple turns, selecting video segments progressively based on
the evolving understanding of previously processed segments and the current
question. This iterative process allows for a more refined and contextually
aware analysis of the video. To ensure intermediate reasoning process, we
introduce a novel gated bi-level reward system, combining trajectory-level
rewards based on answer correctness and turn-level rewards emphasizing
frame-query relevance. This system optimizes both video segment selection and
question comprehension, eliminating the need for external VLMs and allowing
end-to-end training. Extensive experiments on benchmarks like VideoMME, MLVU,
and EgoSchema demonstrate that Video-MTR outperforms existing methods in both
accuracy and efficiency, advancing the state-of-the-art in long video
understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TTA方法未能解决M3OD中固有的双重不确定性（语义不确定性和几何不确定性），导致在真实世界域偏移下性能下降。

Method: 提出双重不确定性优化(DUO)框架，包括：1）基于凸优化的新型无监督focal loss实现不确定性加权；2）语义感知法向场约束保持几何一致性；3）双分支互补机制。

Result: 在多种数据集和域偏移类型上的广泛实验表明，DUO优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DUO通过联合优化双重不确定性，显著提升了单目3D目标检测在域偏移条件下的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Accurate monocular 3D object detection (M3OD) is pivotal for safety-critical
applications like autonomous driving, yet its reliability deteriorates
significantly under real-world domain shifts caused by environmental or sensor
variations. To address these shifts, Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods have
emerged, enabling models to adapt to target distributions during inference.
While prior TTA approaches recognize the positive correlation between low
uncertainty and high generalization ability, they fail to address the dual
uncertainty inherent to M3OD: semantic uncertainty (ambiguous class
predictions) and geometric uncertainty (unstable spatial localization). To
bridge this gap, we propose Dual Uncertainty Optimization (DUO), the first TTA
framework designed to jointly minimize both uncertainties for robust M3OD.
Through a convex optimization lens, we introduce an innovative convex structure
of the focal loss and further derive a novel unsupervised version, enabling
label-agnostic uncertainty weighting and balanced learning for high-uncertainty
objects. In parallel, we design a semantic-aware normal field constraint that
preserves geometric coherence in regions with clear semantic cues, reducing
uncertainty from the unstable 3D representation. This dual-branch mechanism
forms a complementary loop: enhanced spatial perception improves semantic
classification, and robust semantic predictions further refine spatial
understanding. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of DUO over
existing methods across various datasets and domain shift types.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have led to more studies to enhance golfers'
shot precision. However, these existing studies have not quantitatively
established the relationship between swing posture and ball trajectory,
limiting their ability to provide golfers with the necessary insights for swing
improvement. In this paper, we propose a new dataset called CaddieSet, which
includes joint information and various ball information from a single shot.
CaddieSet extracts joint information from a single swing video by segmenting it
into eight swing phases using a computer vision-based approach. Furthermore,
based on expert golf domain knowledge, we define 15 key metrics that influence
a golf swing, enabling the interpretation of swing outcomes through
swing-related features. Through experiments, we demonstrated the feasibility of
CaddieSet for predicting ball trajectories using various benchmarks. In
particular, we focus on interpretable models among several benchmarks and
verify that swing feedback using our joint features is quantitatively
consistent with established domain knowledge. This work is expected to offer
new insight into golf swing analysis for both academia and the sports industry.

Result: 在MVTec 3D-AD数据集上的大量实验表明，IAENet实现了新的最先进性能，误报率显著降低，具有工业部署的实用价值。

Conclusion: IAENet通过有效整合2D和3D专家模型的知识，成功解决了3D表面异常检测的瓶颈问题，为工业质量检测提供了高性能解决方案。

Abstract: Surface anomaly detection is pivotal for ensuring product quality in
industrial manufacturing. While 2D image-based methods have achieved remarkable
success, 3D point cloud-based detection remains underexplored despite its
richer geometric cues. We argue that the key bottleneck is the absence of
powerful pretrained foundation backbones in 3D comparable to those in 2D. To
bridge this gap, we propose Importance-Aware Ensemble Network (IAENet), an
ensemble framework that synergizes 2D pretrained expert with 3D expert models.
However, naively fusing predictions from disparate sources is non-trivial:
existing strategies can be affected by a poorly performing modality and thus
degrade overall accuracy. To address this challenge, We introduce an novel
Importance-Aware Fusion (IAF) module that dynamically assesses the contribution
of each source and reweights their anomaly scores. Furthermore, we devise
critical loss functions that explicitly guide the optimization of IAF, enabling
it to combine the collective knowledge of the source experts but also preserve
their unique strengths, thereby enhancing the overall performance of anomaly
detection. Extensive experiments on MVTec 3D-AD demonstrate that our IAENet
achieves a new state-of-the-art with a markedly lower false positive rate,
underscoring its practical value for industrial deployment.

Conclusion: DescriptiveEdit框架通过重新定义编辑任务为基于参考的生成，克服了现有方法的局限性，具有更好的可扩展性和编辑性能。

Abstract: Despite the progress in text-to-image generation, semantic image editing
remains a challenge. Inversion-based algorithms unavoidably introduce
reconstruction errors, while instruction-based models mainly suffer from
limited dataset quality and scale. To address these problems, we propose a
descriptive-prompt-based editing framework, named DescriptiveEdit. The core
idea is to re-frame `instruction-based image editing' as `reference-image-based
text-to-image generation', which preserves the generative power of well-trained
Text-to-Image models without architectural modifications or inversion.
Specifically, taking the reference image and a prompt as input, we introduce a
Cross-Attentive UNet, which newly adds attention bridges to inject reference
image features into the prompt-to-edit-image generation process. Owing to its
text-to-image nature, DescriptiveEdit overcomes limitations in instruction
dataset quality, integrates seamlessly with ControlNet, IP-Adapter, and other
extensions, and is more scalable. Experiments on the Emu Edit benchmark show it
improves editing accuracy and consistency.

TL;DR: DCFS是一个新颖的持续测试时适应框架，通过双路径特征一致性和置信度感知样本学习来解决伪标签质量问题和错误累积问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在无法访问源域数据的情况下，现有方法依赖模型预测生成伪标签，但伪标签质量无法保证且存在错误累积问题，需要新的解决方案。

Method: 使用双分类器将目标数据特征解耦为语义相关特征和域相关特征，保持子特征与整体特征的一致性，并设置自适应阈值进行置信度加权的自监督学习。

Result: 在CIFAR10-C、CIFAR100-C和ImageNet-C等多个数据集上的广泛实验验证了该方法的有效性，在持续测试时适应场景中表现出稳定的性能。

Conclusion: DCFS框架通过特征解耦和置信度感知学习，能够全面捕捉数据特征的多角度信息，有效减少伪标签噪声并缓解错误累积问题。

Abstract: Continual test-time adaptation aims to continuously adapt a pre-trained model
to a stream of target domain data without accessing source data. Without access
to source domain data, the model focuses solely on the feature characteristics
of the target data. Relying exclusively on these features can lead to confusion
and introduce learning biases. Currently, many existing methods generate
pseudo-labels via model predictions. However, the quality of pseudo-labels
cannot be guaranteed and the problem of error accumulation must be solved. To
address these challenges, we propose DCFS, a novel CTTA framework that
introduces dual-path feature consistency and confidence-aware sample learning.
This framework disentangles the whole feature representation of the target data
into semantic-related feature and domain-related feature using dual classifiers
to learn distinct feature representations. By maintaining consistency between
the sub-features and the whole feature, the model can comprehensively capture
data features from multiple perspectives. Additionally, to ensure that the
whole feature information of the target domain samples is not overlooked, we
set a adaptive threshold and calculate a confidence score for each sample to
carry out loss weighted self-supervised learning, effectively reducing the
noise of pseudo-labels and alleviating the problem of error accumulation. The
efficacy of our proposed method is validated through extensive experimentation
across various datasets, including CIFAR10-C, CIFAR100-C, and ImageNet-C,
demonstrating consistent performance in continual test-time adaptation
scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 相机标定质量对新颖视角合成至关重要，1像素误差就会显著影响重建质量，但真实场景缺乏地面真值，需要通过新视角合成质量来评估标定质量

Method: 利用3DGS模型，通过反向传播新视角颜色损失来优化相机参数，实现相机标定的微调

Result: 在3DGS使用的参考数据集上，新标定方法平均带来0.4 dB PSNR的提升

Conclusion: 虽然微调过程可能耗时且适用性取决于训练时间要求，但对于参考场景（如Mip-NeRF 360）的标定，新视角质量是最重要的考量因素

Abstract: The quality of the camera calibration is of major importance for evaluating
progresses in novel view synthesis, as a 1-pixel error on the calibration has a
significant impact on the reconstruction quality. While there is no ground
truth for real scenes, the quality of the calibration is assessed by the
quality of the novel view synthesis. This paper proposes to use a 3DGS model to
fine tune calibration by backpropagation of novel view color loss with respect
to the cameras parameters. The new calibration alone brings an average
improvement of 0.4 dB PSNR on the dataset used as reference by 3DGS. The fine
tuning may be long and its suitability depends on the criticity of training
time, but for calibration of reference scenes, such as Mip-NeRF 360, the stake
of novel view quality is the most important.

Abstract: Accurate gross tumor volume segmentation on multi-modal medical data is
critical for radiotherapy planning in nasopharyngeal carcinoma and
glioblastoma. Recent advances in deep neural networks have brought promising
results in medical image segmentation, leading to an increasing demand for
labeled data. Since labeling medical images is time-consuming and
labor-intensive, active learning has emerged as a solution to reduce annotation
costs by selecting the most informative samples to label and adapting
high-performance models with as few labeled samples as possible. Previous
active domain adaptation (ADA) methods seek to minimize sample redundancy by
selecting samples that are farthest from the source domain. However, such
one-off selection can easily cause negative transfer, and access to source
medical data is often limited. Moreover, the query strategy for multi-modal
medical data remains unexplored. In this work, we propose an active and
sequential domain adaptation framework for dynamic multi-modal sample selection
in ADA. We derive a query strategy to prioritize labeling and training on the
most valuable samples based on their informativeness and representativeness.
Empirical validation on diverse gross tumor volume segmentation tasks
demonstrates that our method achieves favorable segmentation performance,
significantly outperforming state-of-the-art ADA methods. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 一种新的数据级融合框架，通过早期融合LiDAR和RGB图像数据，利用视觉基础模型进行实例分割和深度估计，通过双向融合和动态自成长策略提升伪标签质量，在nuScenes数据集上实现了3D无监督检测的显著性能提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统LiDAR基础3D检测器依赖人工标注标签的问题，这种标注方式耗时耗力。虽然有研究尝试使用RGB图像辅助生成伪标签，但现有方法的标签级融合策略忽视了LiDAR和RGB数据在表征上的互补性，导致伪标签质量提升有限

Method: 提出数据级融合框架：1)利用视觉基础模型进行实例分割和深度估计；2)双向融合策略：真实点获取类别标签，2D像素投影到3D提升点密度；3)局部全局筛选法消除深度和分割噪声；4)数据级融合基础的动态自成长策略，迭代精炼伪标签

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上进行了广泛实验，训练的检测器在nuScenes验证集上达到28.4%的mAP，显著超过了之前的最先进方法

Conclusion: 该方法通过数据级早期融合策略，充分利用了LiDAR和RGB数据的互补特性，有效提升了3D无监督检测的性能，为解决人工标注成本高的问题提供了有效途径

Abstract: Existing LiDAR-based 3D object detectors typically rely on manually annotated
labels for training to achieve good performance. However, obtaining
high-quality 3D labels is time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address this
issue, recent works explore unsupervised 3D object detection by introducing RGB
images as an auxiliary modal to assist pseudo-box generation. However, these
methods simply integrate pseudo-boxes generated by LiDAR point clouds and RGB
images. Yet, such a label-level fusion strategy brings limited improvements to
the quality of pseudo-boxes, as it overlooks the complementary nature in terms
of LiDAR and RGB image data. To overcome the above limitations, we propose a
novel data-level fusion framework that integrates RGB images and LiDAR data at
an early stage. Specifically, we utilize vision foundation models for instance
segmentation and depth estimation on images and introduce a bi-directional
fusion method, where real points acquire category labels from the 2D space,
while 2D pixels are projected onto 3D to enhance real point density. To
mitigate noise from depth and segmentation estimations, we propose a local and
global filtering method, which applies local radius filtering to suppress depth
estimation errors and global statistical filtering to remove
segmentation-induced outliers. Furthermore, we propose a data-level fusion
based dynamic self-evolution strategy, which iteratively refines pseudo-boxes
under a dense representation, significantly improving localization accuracy.
Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that the detector
trained by our method significantly outperforms that trained by previous
state-of-the-art methods with 28.4$\%$ mAP on the nuScenes validation
benchmark.

TL;DR: 通过深度学习方法从手机图片估计BMI，使用自动过滤技术精简大规模数据集，在私有数据集上达到7.9% MAPE，并在外部数据集上展现良好的泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在远程医疗或紧急情况下，传统BMI测量方法可能无法使用或不实用，需要一种速度快、方便的视觉化估算方法。

Method: 开发WayBED数据集（84,963张图片），采用姿势聚类和人体检测进行自动过滤，保留71,322张高质量图片进行训练，并使用深度学习模型进行BMI估算。

Result: 在私有数据集上达到7.9% MAPE（最低记录），在外部VisualBodyToBMI数据集上达到13% MAPE，细调后达到8.56% MAPE（该数据集最佳结果），并实现了移动端部署。

Conclusion: 该方法能够通过视觉图片准确估算BMI，具有良好的泛化性能和实际应用价值，为远程健康监测提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Estimating Body Mass Index (BMI) from camera images with machine learning
models enables rapid weight assessment when traditional methods are unavailable
or impractical, such as in telehealth or emergency scenarios. Existing computer
vision approaches have been limited to datasets of up to 14,500 images. In this
study, we present a deep learning-based BMI estimation method trained on our
WayBED dataset, a large proprietary collection of 84,963 smartphone images from
25,353 individuals. We introduce an automatic filtering method that uses
posture clustering and person detection to curate the dataset by removing
low-quality images, such as those with atypical postures or incomplete views.
This process retained 71,322 high-quality images suitable for training. We
achieve a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 7.9% on our hold-out test
set (WayBED data) using full-body images, the lowest value in the published
literature to the best of our knowledge. Further, we achieve a MAPE of 13% on
the completely unseen~(during training) VisualBodyToBMI dataset, comparable
with state-of-the-art approaches trained on it, demonstrating robust
generalization. Lastly, we fine-tune our model on VisualBodyToBMI and achieve a
MAPE of 8.56%, the lowest reported value on this dataset so far. We deploy the
full pipeline, including image filtering and BMI estimation, on Android devices
using the CLAID framework. We release our complete code for model training,
filtering, and the CLAID package for mobile deployment as open-source
contributions.

Motivation: 为了更好地理解领域适配技术在自然图像和医学图像上的效果，充当主流数据集导致的性能偏差问题。

Method: 使用7种广泛使用的领域适配技术，在5个自然图像数据集和8个医学图像数据集上进行557个模拟实验，涵盖分布外、动态数据流和有限训练样本等多种场景。

Result: DSAN算法表现最优，在COVID-19数据集上达到91.2%的分类准确率，在动态数据流场景中比基线提高6.7%，并在COVID-19和皮肤癌数据集上展现出显著的可解释性。

Conclusion: 该研究深化了对领域适配技术的理解，为模型在医学数据上的有效适配提供了价值较高的见解，尤其推荐DSAN算法在医学领域适配中的应用。

Abstract: Domain adaptation (DA) techniques have the potential in machine learning to
alleviate distribution differences between training and test sets by leveraging
information from source domains. In image classification, most advances in DA
have been made using natural images rather than medical data, which are harder
to work with. Moreover, even for natural images, the use of mainstream datasets
can lead to performance bias. {With the aim of better understanding the
benefits of DA for both natural and medical images, this study performs 557
simulation studies using seven widely-used DA techniques for image
classification in five natural and eight medical datasets that cover various
scenarios, such as out-of-distribution, dynamic data streams, and limited
training samples.} Our experiments yield detailed results and insightful
observations highlighting the performance and medical applicability of these
techniques. Notably, our results have shown the outstanding performance of the
Deep Subdomain Adaptation Network (DSAN) algorithm. This algorithm achieved
feasible classification accuracy (91.2\%) in the COVID-19 dataset using
Resnet50 and showed an important accuracy improvement in the dynamic data
stream DA scenario (+6.7\%) compared to the baseline. Our results also
demonstrate that DSAN exhibits remarkable level of explainability when
evaluated on COVID-19 and skin cancer datasets. These results contribute to the
understanding of DA techniques and offer valuable insight into the effective
adaptation of models to medical data.

Motivation: 解决视频物体棆测中因运动模糊、遮挡等因素导致的图像劣化问题，同时避免传统方法的高计算成本

Method: 提出CLAB方法，包括：1）使用对比损失的辅助分支来增强特征表示能力；2）动态损失权重策略，在训练初期重视辅助特征学习，随着训练逐渐重视检测任务

Result: 在ImageNet VID数据集上达到独立新的性能标准：ResNet-101获得84.0% mAP，ResNeXt-101获得85.2% mAP，无需额外后处理方法

Conclusion: CLAB方法通过简单有效的对比学习和动态权重调整，在不增加计算费用的情况下显著提升了视频物体检测的稳健性和性能

Abstract: Video object detection is a challenging task because videos often suffer from
image deterioration such as motion blur, occlusion, and deformable shapes,
making it significantly more difficult than detecting objects in still images.
Prior approaches have improved video object detection performance by employing
feature aggregation and complex post-processing techniques, though at the cost
of increased computational demands. To improve robustness to image degradation
without additional computational load during inference, we introduce a
straightforward yet effective Contrastive Learning through Auxiliary Branch
(CLAB) method. First, we implement a constrastive auxiliary branch using a
contrastive loss to enhance the feature representation capability of the video
object detector's backbone. Next, we propose a dynamic loss weighting strategy
that emphasizes auxiliary feature learning early in training while gradually
prioritizing the detection task as training converges. We validate our approach
through comprehensive experiments and ablation studies, demonstrating
consistent performance gains. Without bells and whistles, CLAB reaches a
performance of 84.0% mAP and 85.2% mAP with ResNet-101 and ResNeXt-101,
respectively, on the ImageNet VID dataset, thus achieving state-of-the-art
performance for CNN-based models without requiring additional post-processing
methods.

Motivation: 排印攻击通过在图像中注入文本来导致多模态系统的目标错误分类、恶意内容生成和VLM盗窃，需要有效的防御方法。

Method: 分析CLIP视觉编码器在排印攻击下的行为，定位专门的注意头，并通过选择性消除排印电路（由注意头组成）来防御攻击。方法无需微调。

Result: 方法在ImageNet-100排印变体上提高了达19.6%的性能，而标准ImageNet-100准确性仅下降不到1%。该无训练方法与依赖微调的状态前沿方法竞争力相当。

Conclusion: 研究发布了一系列隐读障碍CLIP模型，这些模型在安全关键应用中作为适合的直接替换方案，特别是在文本操控风险超过文本识别效用的场景下。

Abstract: Typographic attacks exploit multi-modal systems by injecting text into
images, leading to targeted misclassifications, malicious content generation
and even Vision-Language Model jailbreaks. In this work, we analyze how CLIP
vision encoders behave under typographic attacks, locating specialized
attention heads in the latter half of the model's layers that causally extract
and transmit typographic information to the cls token. Building on these
insights, we introduce a method to defend CLIP models against typographic
attacks by selectively ablating a typographic circuit, consisting of attention
heads. Without requiring finetuning, our method improves performance by up to
19.6% on a typographic variant of ImageNet-100, while reducing standard
ImageNet-100 accuracy by less than 1%. Notably, our training-free approach
remains competitive with current state-of-the-art typographic defenses that
rely on finetuning. To this end, we release a family of dyslexic CLIP models
which are significantly more robust against typographic attacks. These models
serve as suitable drop-in replacements for a broad range of safety-critical
applications, where the risks of text-based manipulation outweigh the utility
of text recognition.

Abstract: Facial expression recognition (FER) is a crucial task in computer vision with
wide range of applications including human computer interaction, surveillance,
and assistive technologies. However, challenges such as occlusion, expression
variability, and lack of interpretability hinder the performance of traditional
FER systems. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a powerful alternative by
modeling relational dependencies between facial landmarks, enabling structured
and interpretable learning. In this paper, we propose GLaRE, a novel
Graph-based Landmark Region Embedding network for emotion recognition. Facial
landmarks are extracted using 3D facial alignment, and a quotient graph is
constructed via hierarchical coarsening to preserve spatial structure while
reducing complexity. Our method achieves 64.89 percentage accuracy on AffectNet
and 94.24 percentage on FERG, outperforming several existing baselines.
Additionally, ablation studies have demonstrated that region-level embeddings
from quotient graphs have contributed to improved prediction performance.

Conclusion: FastFit成功解决了多参考虚拟试穿的效率和功能限制问题，通过创新的架构设计实现了高性能和高效率，为复杂多参考虚拟试穿研究提供了新的数据集和技术基础。

Abstract: Despite its great potential, virtual try-on technology is hindered from
real-world application by two major challenges: the inability of current
methods to support multi-reference outfit compositions (including garments and
accessories), and their significant inefficiency caused by the redundant
re-computation of reference features in each denoising step. To address these
challenges, we propose FastFit, a high-speed multi-reference virtual try-on
framework based on a novel cacheable diffusion architecture. By employing a
Semi-Attention mechanism and substituting traditional timestep embeddings with
class embeddings for reference items, our model fully decouples reference
feature encoding from the denoising process with negligible parameter overhead.
This allows reference features to be computed only once and losslessly reused
across all steps, fundamentally breaking the efficiency bottleneck and
achieving an average 3.5x speedup over comparable methods. Furthermore, to
facilitate research on complex, multi-reference virtual try-on, we introduce
DressCode-MR, a new large-scale dataset. It comprises 28,179 sets of
high-quality, paired images covering five key categories (tops, bottoms,
dresses, shoes, and bags), constructed through a pipeline of expert models and
human feedback refinement. Extensive experiments on the VITON-HD, DressCode,
and our DressCode-MR datasets show that FastFit surpasses state-of-the-art
methods on key fidelity metrics while offering its significant advantage in
inference efficiency.

Conclusion: UTA-Sign方法有效解决了低光照环境下交通标志感知的挑战，通过热成像和事件相机的互补融合提升了自动驾驶系统的环境理解能力

Abstract: The thermal camera excels at perceiving outdoor environments under low-light
conditions, making it ideal for applications such as nighttime autonomous
driving and unmanned navigation. However, thermal cameras encounter challenges
when capturing signage from objects made of similar materials, which can pose
safety risks for accurately understanding semantics in autonomous driving
systems. In contrast, the neuromorphic vision camera, also known as an event
camera, detects changes in light intensity asynchronously and has proven
effective in high-speed, low-light traffic environments. Recognizing the
complementary characteristics of these two modalities, this paper proposes
UTA-Sign, an unsupervised thermal-event video augmentation for traffic signage
in low-illumination environments, targeting elements such as license plates and
roadblock indicators. To address the signage blind spots of thermal imaging and
the non-uniform sampling of event cameras, we developed a dual-boosting
mechanism that fuses thermal frames and event signals for consistent signage
representation over time. The proposed method utilizes thermal frames to
provide accurate motion cues as temporal references for aligning the uneven
event signals. At the same time, event signals contribute subtle signage
content to the raw thermal frames, enhancing the overall understanding of the
environment. The proposed method is validated on datasets collected from
real-world scenarios, demonstrating superior quality in traffic signage
sketching and improved detection accuracy at the perceptual level.

Conclusion: 提出的主动防御方法通过低频扰动直接针对深度伪造生成过程，有效破坏了人脸交换操作，为深度伪造防御提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Deepfake technology, driven by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), poses
significant risks to privacy and societal security. Existing detection methods
are predominantly passive, focusing on post-event analysis without preventing
attacks. To address this, we propose an active defense method based on
low-frequency perceptual perturbations to disrupt face swapping manipulation,
reducing the performance and naturalness of generated content. Unlike prior
approaches that used low-frequency perturbations to impact classification
accuracy,our method directly targets the generative process of deepfake
techniques. We combine frequency and spatial domain features to strengthen
defenses. By introducing artifacts through low-frequency perturbations while
preserving high-frequency details, we ensure the output remains visually
plausible. Additionally, we design a complete architecture featuring an
encoder, a perturbation generator, and a decoder, leveraging discrete wavelet
transform (DWT) to extract low-frequency components and generate perturbations
that disrupt facial manipulation models. Experiments on CelebA-HQ and LFW
demonstrate significant reductions in face-swapping effectiveness, improved
defense success rates, and preservation of visual quality.

Abstract: Generating 3D human motions from text is a challenging yet valuable task. The
key aspects of this task are ensuring text-motion consistency and achieving
generation diversity. Although recent advancements have enabled the generation
of precise and high-quality human motions from text, achieving diversity in the
generated motions remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we aim to
overcome the above challenge by designing a simple yet effective text-to-motion
generation method, \textit{i.e.}, Diverse-T2M. Our method introduces
uncertainty into the generation process, enabling the generation of highly
diverse motions while preserving the semantic consistency of the text.
Specifically, we propose a novel perspective that utilizes noise signals as
carriers of diversity information in transformer-based methods, facilitating a
explicit modeling of uncertainty. Moreover, we construct a latent space where
text is projected into a continuous representation, instead of a rigid
one-to-one mapping, and integrate a latent space sampler to introduce
stochastic sampling into the generation process, thereby enhancing the
diversity and uncertainty of the outputs. Our results on text-to-motion
generation benchmark datasets~(HumanML3D and KIT-ML) demonstrate that our
method significantly enhances diversity while maintaining state-of-the-art
performance in text consistency.

Abstract: Intraoperative ultrasound images are inherently challenging to interpret in
liver surgery due to the limited field of view and complex anatomical
structures. Bridging the gap between preoperative and intraoperative data is
crucial for effective surgical guidance. 3D IntraVascular UltraSound (IVUS)
offers a potential solution by enabling the reconstruction of the entire organ,
which facilitates registration between preoperative computed tomography (CT)
scans and intraoperative IVUS images. In this work, we propose an
optimization-based calibration method using a 3D-printed phantom for accurate
3D Intravascular Ultrasound volume reconstruction. Our approach ensures precise
alignment of tracked IVUS data with preoperative CT images, improving
intraoperative navigation. We validated our method using in vivo swine liver
images, achieving a calibration error from 0.88 to 1.80 mm and a registration
error from 3.40 to 5.71 mm between the 3D IVUS data and the corresponding CT
scan. Our method provides a reliable and accurate means of calibration and
volume reconstruction. It can be used to register intraoperative ultrasound
images with preoperative CT images in the context of liver surgery, and enhance
intraoperative guidance.

Abstract: In semiconductor manufacturing, defect detection and localization are
critical to ensuring product quality and yield. While X-ray imaging is a
reliable non-destructive testing method, it is memory-intensive and
time-consuming for large-scale scanning, Magnetic Field Imaging (MFI) offers a
more efficient means to localize regions of interest (ROI) for targeted X-ray
scanning. However, the limited availability of MFI datasets due to proprietary
concerns presents a significant bottleneck for training machine learning (ML)
models using MFI. To address this challenge, we consider an ML-driven approach
leveraging diffusion models with two physical constraints. We propose Physics
Informed Generative Models for Magnetic Field Images (PI-GenMFI) to generate
synthetic MFI samples by integrating specific physical information. We generate
MFI images for the most common defect types: power shorts. These synthetic
images will serve as training data for ML algorithms designed to localize
defect areas efficiently. To evaluate generated MFIs, we compare our model to
SOTA generative models from both variational autoencoder (VAE) and diffusion
methods. We present a domain expert evaluation to assess the generated samples.
In addition, we present qualitative and quantitative evaluation using various
metrics used for image generation and signal processing, showing promising
results to optimize the defect localization process.

Abstract: The growing complexity of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) has led to the adoption
of Split Inference (SI), a collaborative paradigm that partitions computation
between edge devices and the cloud to reduce latency and protect user privacy.
However, recent advances in Data Reconstruction Attacks (DRAs) reveal that
intermediate features exchanged in SI can be exploited to recover sensitive
input data, posing significant privacy risks. Existing DRAs are typically
effective only on shallow models and fail to fully leverage semantic priors,
limiting their reconstruction quality and generalizability across datasets and
model architectures. In this paper, we propose a novel GAN-based DRA framework
with Progressive Feature Optimization (PFO), which decomposes the generator
into hierarchical blocks and incrementally refines intermediate representations
to enhance the semantic fidelity of reconstructed images. To stabilize the
optimization and improve image realism, we introduce an L1-ball constraint
during reconstruction. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms
prior attacks by a large margin, especially in high-resolution scenarios,
out-of-distribution settings, and against deeper and more complex DNNs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有情感说话头合成方法在控制灵活性、运动自然度和表情质量方面存在局限，且现有数据集主要在实验室环境下采集，限制了实际应用。

Method: 提出扩散模型框架EmoCAST，包含文本引导的解耦情感模块（增强空间知识）和情感音频注意力模块（捕捉情感与音频的交互），并构建情感说话头数据集，采用情感感知采样训练和渐进功能训练策略。

Result: EmoCAST在生成真实、情感丰富且音频同步的说话头视频方面达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 该框架通过创新的模块设计和训练策略，成功解决了情感说话头合成中的关键挑战，为实际应用提供了高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: Emotional talking head synthesis aims to generate talking portrait videos
with vivid expressions. Existing methods still exhibit limitations in control
flexibility, motion naturalness, and expression quality. Moreover, currently
available datasets are primarily collected in lab settings, further
exacerbating these shortcomings. Consequently, these limitations substantially
hinder practical applications in real-world scenarios. To address these
challenges, we propose EmoCAST, a diffusion-based framework with two key
modules for precise text-driven emotional synthesis. In appearance modeling,
emotional prompts are integrated through a text-guided decoupled emotive
module, enhancing the spatial knowledge to improve emotion comprehension. To
improve the relationship between audio and emotion, we introduce an emotive
audio attention module to capture the interplay between controlled emotion and
driving audio, generating emotion-aware features to guide more precise facial
motion synthesis. Additionally, we construct an emotional talking head dataset
with comprehensive emotive text descriptions to optimize the framework's
performance. Based on the proposed dataset, we propose an emotion-aware
sampling training strategy and a progressive functional training strategy that
further improve the model's ability to capture nuanced expressive features and
achieve accurate lip-synchronization. Overall, EmoCAST achieves
state-of-the-art performance in generating realistic, emotionally expressive,
and audio-synchronized talking-head videos. Project Page:

Abstract: Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality in
women, and early detection is essential for improving outcomes. Magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) is a highly sensitive tool for breast cancer detection,
particularly in women at high risk or with dense breast tissue, where
mammography is less effective. The ODELIA consortium organized a multi-center
challenge to foster AI-based solutions for breast cancer diagnosis and
classification. The dataset included 511 studies from six European centers,
acquired on scanners from multiple vendors at both 1.5 T and 3 T. Each study
was labeled for the left and right breast as no lesion, benign lesion, or
malignant lesion. We developed a SwinUNETR-based deep learning framework that
incorporates breast region masking, extensive data augmentation, and ensemble
learning to improve robustness and generalizability. Our method achieved second
place on the challenge leaderboard, highlighting its potential to support
clinical breast MRI interpretation. We publicly share our codebase at

TL;DR: AvatarBack是一个用于3D高斯头像重建的即插即用框架，通过生成身份一致的后视图伪图像和自适应空间对齐策略，解决了现有方法后脑重建质量差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于高斯泼溅的头像重建方法主要依赖正面视图图像，导致后脑区域重建质量差，存在几何不一致、结构模糊和真实感降低等问题，限制了重建头像的保真度。

Method: 提出AvatarBack框架，包含两个核心技术：1）主体特定生成器（SSG）利用生成先验从稀疏正面输入合成身份一致的后视图伪图像；2）自适应空间对齐策略（ASA）使用可学习变换矩阵优化合成视图与3D高斯表示之间的几何对齐。

Result: 在NeRSemble和K-hairstyle数据集上的实验表明，AvatarBack显著提升了后脑重建质量，同时保持了正面保真度，重建的头像在不同运动下保持一致的视觉真实感且完全可动画化。

Conclusion: AvatarBack通过显式建模缺失的后脑区域，成功解决了3D高斯头像重建中的后脑质量问题，为完整且一致的3D头像重建提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in Gaussian Splatting have significantly boosted the
reconstruction of head avatars, enabling high-quality facial modeling by
representing an 3D avatar as a collection of 3D Gaussians. However, existing
methods predominantly rely on frontal-view images, leaving the back-head poorly
constructed. This leads to geometric inconsistencies, structural blurring, and
reduced realism in the rear regions, ultimately limiting the fidelity of
reconstructed avatars. To address this challenge, we propose AvatarBack, a
novel plug-and-play framework specifically designed to reconstruct complete and
consistent 3D Gaussian avatars by explicitly modeling the missing back-head
regions. AvatarBack integrates two core technical innovations,i.e., the
Subject-specific Generator (SSG) and the Adaptive Spatial Alignment Strategy
(ASA). The former leverages a generative prior to synthesize
identity-consistent, plausible back-view pseudo-images from sparse frontal
inputs, providing robust multi-view supervision. To achieve precise geometric
alignment between these synthetic views and the 3D Gaussian representation, the
later employs learnable transformation matrices optimized during training,
effectively resolving inherent pose and coordinate discrepancies. Extensive
experiments on NeRSemble and K-hairstyle datasets, evaluated using geometric,
photometric, and GPT-4o-based perceptual metrics, demonstrate that AvatarBack
significantly enhances back-head reconstruction quality while preserving
frontal fidelity. Moreover, the reconstructed avatars maintain consistent
visual realism under diverse motions and remain fully animatable.

Abstract: Identifying sitters in historical paintings is a key task for art historians,
offering insight into their lives and how they chose to be seen. However, the
process is often subjective and limited by the lack of data and stylistic
variations. Automated facial recognition is capable of handling challenging
conditions and can assist, but while traditional facial recognition models
perform well on photographs, they struggle with paintings due to domain shift
and high intra-class variation. Artistic factors such as style, skill, intent,
and influence from other works further complicate recognition. In this work, we
investigate the potential of foundation models to improve facial recognition in
artworks. By fine-tuning foundation models and integrating their embeddings
with those from conventional facial recognition networks, we demonstrate
notable improvements over current state-of-the-art methods. Our results show
that foundation models can bridge the gap where traditional methods are
ineffective. Paper page at https://www.idiap.ch/paper/artface/

TL;DR: CraftGraffiti是一个端到端的文本引导涂鸦生成框架，通过风格优先、身份保持的方法解决极端风格变换中面部身份保持的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在涂鸦这种高对比度抽象媒介中，面部特征的细微扭曲会消除主体的可识别性，破坏个人和文化真实性，需要解决身份保持问题。

Method: 使用LoRA微调的预训练扩散transformer进行涂鸦风格迁移，通过面部一致性自注意力机制增强身份嵌入，采用CLIP引导的提示扩展实现无关键点的姿态定制。

Result: 定量结果显示竞争性的面部特征一致性和最先进的美学评分，定性分析和现场部署证明了系统的实际创意影响。

Conclusion: CraftGraffiti推进了身份尊重的AI辅助艺术目标，为创意AI应用中风格自由与可识别性的融合提供了原则性方法。

Abstract: Preserving facial identity under extreme stylistic transformation remains a
major challenge in generative art. In graffiti, a high-contrast, abstract
medium, subtle distortions to the eyes, nose, or mouth can erase the subject's
recognizability, undermining both personal and cultural authenticity. We
present CraftGraffiti, an end-to-end text-guided graffiti generation framework
designed with facial feature preservation as a primary objective. Given an
input image and a style and pose descriptive prompt, CraftGraffiti first
applies graffiti style transfer via LoRA-fine-tuned pretrained diffusion
transformer, then enforces identity fidelity through a face-consistent
self-attention mechanism that augments attention layers with explicit identity
embeddings. Pose customization is achieved without keypoints, using CLIP-guided
prompt extension to enable dynamic re-posing while retaining facial coherence.
We formally justify and empirically validate the "style-first, identity-after"
paradigm, showing it reduces attribute drift compared to the reverse order.
Quantitative results demonstrate competitive facial feature consistency and
state-of-the-art aesthetic and human preference scores, while qualitative
analyses and a live deployment at the Cruilla Festival highlight the system's
real-world creative impact. CraftGraffiti advances the goal of
identity-respectful AI-assisted artistry, offering a principled approach for
blending stylistic freedom with recognizability in creative AI applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LVLM对齐方法依赖外部数据集、人工标注或复杂后处理，成本高且扩展性差，需要更有效的自主对齐解决方案

Method: 生成去偏自评分数作为内部自评估指标，无需外部资源，通过改进解码策略和偏好调优过程实现自主对齐

Result: 显著优于传统方法，有效减少幻觉、增强安全性并提升整体能力

Conclusion: 该方法为LVLM对齐提供了更有效的解决方案，实现了自主改进的多模态对齐

Abstract: The rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large
Visual-Language Models (LVLMs) have opened up new opportunities for integrating
visual and linguistic modalities. However, effectively aligning these
modalities remains challenging, often leading to hallucinations--where
generated outputs are not grounded in the visual input--and raising safety
concerns across various domains. Existing alignment methods, such as
instruction tuning and preference tuning, often rely on external datasets,
human annotations, or complex post-processing, which limit scalability and
increase costs. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that
generates the debiased self-judgment score, a self-evaluation metric created
internally by the model without relying on external resources. This enables the
model to autonomously improve alignment. Our method enhances both decoding
strategies and preference tuning processes, resulting in reduced
hallucinations, enhanced safety, and improved overall capability. Empirical
results show that our approach significantly outperforms traditional methods,
offering a more effective solution for aligning LVLMs.

Method: 构建S-HArM数据集，探索三种提示策略（图像引导、描述引导、多模态引导）使用Stable Diffusion构建大规模合成训练数据集，比较了多种模型架构包括模态融合、对比学习、重建网络、注意力机制和大规模视觉语言模型。

Result: 在图像引导和多模态引导数据上训练的模型对真实内容泛化更好，因为保留了视觉上下文。但整体性能仍然有限。

Conclusion: 推断意图具有复杂性，需要专门架构来解决这一挑战，保留视觉上下文对模型泛化能力很重要。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal AI have enabled progress in detecting synthetic
and out-of-context content. However, existing efforts largely overlook the
intent behind AI-generated images. To fill this gap, we introduce S-HArM, a
multimodal dataset for intent-aware classification, comprising 9,576 "in the
wild" image-text pairs from Twitter/X and Reddit, labeled as Humor/Satire, Art,
or Misinformation. Additionally, we explore three prompting strategies
(image-guided, description-guided, and multimodally-guided) to construct a
large-scale synthetic training dataset with Stable Diffusion. We conduct an
extensive comparative study including modality fusion, contrastive learning,
reconstruction networks, attention mechanisms, and large vision-language
models. Our results show that models trained on image- and multimodally-guided
data generalize better to "in the wild" content, due to preserved visual
context. However, overall performance remains limited, highlighting the
complexity of inferring intent and the need for specialized architectures.

Abstract: Foundation image-text models such as CLIP with zero-shot capabilities enable
a wide array of applications. MobileCLIP is a recent family of image-text
models at 3-15ms latency and 50-150M parameters with state-of-the-art zero-shot
accuracy. The main ingredients in MobileCLIP were its low-latency and light
architectures and a novel multi-modal reinforced training that made knowledge
distillation from multiple caption-generators and CLIP teachers efficient,
scalable, and reproducible. In this paper, we improve the multi-modal
reinforced training of MobileCLIP through: 1) better CLIP teacher ensembles
trained on the DFN dataset, 2) improved captioner teachers trained on the DFN
dataset and fine-tuned on a diverse selection of high-quality image-caption
datasets. We discover new insights through ablations such as the importance of
temperature tuning in contrastive knowledge distillation, the effectiveness of
caption-generator fine-tuning for caption diversity, and the additive
improvement from combining synthetic captions generated by multiple models. We
train a new family of models called MobileCLIP2 and achieve state-of-the-art
ImageNet-1k zero-shot accuracies at low latencies. In particular, we observe
2.2% improvement in ImageNet-1k accuracy for MobileCLIP2-B compared with
MobileCLIP-B architecture. Notably, MobileCLIP2-S4 matches the zero-shot
accuracy of SigLIP-SO400M/14 on ImageNet-1k while being 2$\times$ smaller and
improves on DFN ViT-L/14 at 2.5$\times$ lower latency. We release our
pretrained models (https://github.com/apple/ml-mobileclip) and the data
generation code (https://github.com/apple/ml-mobileclip-dr). The data
generation code makes it easy to create new reinforced datasets with arbitrary

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了神经视频压缩中的磁率控制问题，在保持高性能的同时实现了精确的变磁率控制，适用于各种磁率和磁率约束应用场景

Abstract: Neural Video Compression (NVC) has achieved remarkable performance in recent
years. However, precise rate control remains a challenge due to the inherent
limitations of learning-based codecs. To solve this issue, we propose a dynamic
video compression framework designed for variable bitrate scenarios. First, to
achieve variable bitrate implementation, we propose the Dynamic-Route
Autoencoder with variable coding routes, each occupying partial computational
complexity of the whole network and navigating to a distinct RD trade-off.
Second, to approach the target bitrate, the Rate Control Agent estimates the
bitrate of each route and adjusts the coding route of DRA at run time. To
encompass a broad spectrum of variable bitrates while preserving overall RD
performance, we employ the Joint-Routes Optimization strategy, achieving
collaborative training of various routes. Extensive experiments on the HEVC and
UVG datasets show that the proposed method achieves an average BD-Rate
reduction of 14.8% and BD-PSNR gain of 0.47dB over state-of-the-art methods
while maintaining an average bitrate error of 1.66%, achieving
Rate-Distortion-Complexity Optimization (RDCO) for various bitrate and

Motivation: 现有心脏运动估计方法依赖基于强度的图像配准相似性损失，往往忽略心脏解剖区域，导致运动捕捉不准确。需要一种能够专注于解剖区域的心脏运动估计方法。

Method: 提出循环贝叶斯深度学习框架CardioMorphNet，使用循环变分自编码器建模时空依赖，通过两个后验模型进行双心室分割和运动估计，利用分割图递归配准而不使用强度相似性损失。

Result: 在UK Biobank数据集上验证，CardioMorphNet在心脏运动估计方面表现优于最先进方法，形变掩模形状与真实掩模匹配更好，且产生的心脏区域运动场不确定性更低。

Conclusion: CardioMorphNet通过形状引导的贝叶斯框架成功解决了心脏运动估计问题，提供了更准确的运动场估计和更低的不确定性，表明其预测具有更高置信度。

Abstract: Accurate cardiac motion estimation from cine cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR)
images is vital for assessing cardiac function and detecting its abnormalities.
Existing methods often struggle to capture heart motion accurately because they
rely on intensity-based image registration similarity losses that may overlook
cardiac anatomical regions. To address this, we propose CardioMorphNet, a
recurrent Bayesian deep learning framework for 3D cardiac shape-guided
deformable registration using short-axis (SAX) CMR images. It employs a
recurrent variational autoencoder to model spatio-temporal dependencies over
the cardiac cycle and two posterior models for bi-ventricular segmentation and
motion estimation. The derived loss function from the Bayesian formulation
guides the framework to focus on anatomical regions by recursively registering
segmentation maps without using intensity-based image registration similarity
loss, while leveraging sequential SAX volumes and spatio-temporal features. The
Bayesian modelling also enables computation of uncertainty maps for the
estimated motion fields. Validated on the UK Biobank dataset by comparing
warped mask shapes with ground truth masks, CardioMorphNet demonstrates
superior performance in cardiac motion estimation, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods. Uncertainty assessment shows that it also yields
lower uncertainty values for estimated motion fields in the cardiac region
compared with other probabilistic-based cardiac registration methods,
indicating higher confidence in its predictions.

Abstract: Atypical mitotic figures (AMFs) are important histopathological markers yet
remain challenging to identify consistently, particularly under domain shift
stemming from scanner, stain, and acquisition differences. We present a simple
training-time recipe for domain-robust AMF classification in MIDOG 2025 Task 2.
The approach (i) increases feature diversity via style perturbations inserted
at early and mid backbone stages, (ii) aligns attention-refined features across

auxiliary alignment loss, and (iii) stabilizes predictions by distilling from

Conclusion: 该研究不仅提出了解决奖励攻击问题的新方法Pref-GRPO，还构建了统一的T2I测试基准UniGenBench，为文本到图像生成领域提供了更全面的评估标准和有效的模型优化方案

Abstract: Recent advancements highlight the importance of GRPO-based reinforcement
learning methods and benchmarking in enhancing text-to-image (T2I) generation.
However, current methods using pointwise reward models (RM) for scoring
generated images are susceptible to reward hacking. We reveal that this happens
when minimal score differences between images are amplified after
normalization, creating illusory advantages that drive the model to
over-optimize for trivial gains, ultimately destabilizing the image generation
process. To address this, we propose Pref-GRPO, a pairwise preference
reward-based GRPO method that shifts the optimization objective from score
maximization to preference fitting, ensuring more stable training. In
Pref-GRPO, images are pairwise compared within each group using preference RM,
and the win rate is used as the reward signal. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PREF-GRPO differentiates subtle image quality differences,
providing more stable advantages and mitigating reward hacking. Additionally,
existing T2I benchmarks are limited by coarse evaluation criteria, hindering
comprehensive model assessment. To solve this, we introduce UniGenBench, a
unified T2I benchmark comprising 600 prompts across 5 main themes and 20
subthemes. It evaluates semantic consistency through 10 primary and 27
sub-criteria, leveraging MLLM for benchmark construction and evaluation. Our
benchmarks uncover the strengths and weaknesses of both open and closed-source

Abstract: Generalizable Gaussian Splatting aims to synthesize novel views for unseen

utilize feed-forward networks to predict per-pixel Gaussian parameters,
enabling high-quality synthesis from sparse input views. However, existing
approaches fall short in encoding discriminative, multi-view consistent
features for Gaussian predictions, which struggle to construct accurate

lightweight modules into a unified rendering pipeline, improving feature fusion
and enabling photorealistic synthesis without requiring additional supervision.

TL;DR: SeqVLM是一个新颖的零样本3D视觉定位框架，通过多视角真实场景图像和空间信息进行目标物体推理，在ScanRefer和Nr3D基准测试中实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有零样本3D视觉定位方法因依赖单视角定位而导致的空间推理受限、上下文遗漏和细节退化问题，消除场景特定训练需求，提升现实世界应用的泛化能力。

Method: 首先通过3D语义分割网络生成3D实例提案并进行语义过滤；然后使用提案引导的多视角投影策略将候选提案投影到真实场景图像序列；最后通过动态调度机制迭代处理序列查询提示，利用VLM的跨模态推理能力识别文本指定的对象。

Result: 在ScanRefer和Nr3D基准测试中分别达到55.6%和53.2%的Acc@0.25分数，比之前的零样本方法分别提升了4.0%和5.2%。

Conclusion: SeqVLM框架显著提升了3D视觉定位的零样本性能，推动了3DVG向更好泛化能力和现实世界适用性的发展。

Abstract: 3D Visual Grounding (3DVG) aims to localize objects in 3D scenes using
natural language descriptions. Although supervised methods achieve higher
accuracy in constrained settings, zero-shot 3DVG holds greater promise for
real-world applications since eliminating scene-specific training requirements.
However, existing zero-shot methods face challenges of spatial-limited
reasoning due to reliance on single-view localization, and contextual omissions
or detail degradation. To address these issues, we propose SeqVLM, a novel
zero-shot 3DVG framework that leverages multi-view real-world scene images with
spatial information for target object reasoning. Specifically, SeqVLM first
generates 3D instance proposals via a 3D semantic segmentation network and
refines them through semantic filtering, retaining only semantic-relevant
candidates. A proposal-guided multi-view projection strategy then projects
these candidate proposals onto real scene image sequences, preserving spatial
relationships and contextual details in the conversion process of 3D point
cloud to images. Furthermore, to mitigate VLM computational overload, we
implement a dynamic scheduling mechanism that iteratively processes
sequances-query prompts, leveraging VLM's cross-modal reasoning capabilities to
identify textually specified objects. Experiments on the ScanRefer and Nr3D
benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving Acc@0.25 scores
of 55.6% and 53.2%, surpassing previous zero-shot methods by 4.0% and 5.2%,
respectively, which advance 3DVG toward greater generalization and real-world
applicability. The code is available at https://github.com/JiawLin/SeqVLM.

TL;DR: CLIP模型在军事车辆识别中对遮挡的鲁棒性研究，发现Transformer架构优于CNN，分散遮挡比集中遮挡影响更大，微调可显著提升抗遮挡能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索CLIP视觉语言模型在军事环境中面对遮挡和噪声的鲁棒性，为国防应用中稀缺标注数据场景提供解决方案

Method: 使用18类军事车辆自定义数据集，通过不同遮挡比例评估CLIP变体的性能，采用NAUC指标分析，比较Transformer和CNN架构，进行线性探测和骨干网络微调实验

Result: 1) Transformer-based CLIP优于CNN模型 2) 分散细粒度遮挡比大块连续遮挡影响更大 3) 线性探测模型在35%遮挡时性能急剧下降 4) 骨干网络微调后性能下降延迟到60%遮挡以上

Conclusion: 需要在训练中加入遮挡特定的数据增强，进一步研究补丁级敏感性和架构韧性，以提升CLIP在真实军事部署中的实用性

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP enable zero-shot classification by
aligning images and text in a shared embedding space, offering advantages for
defense applications with scarce labeled data. However, CLIP's robustness in
challenging military environments, with partial occlusion and degraded
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), remains underexplored. We investigate CLIP
variants' robustness to occlusion using a custom dataset of 18 military vehicle
classes and evaluate using Normalized Area Under the Curve (NAUC) across
occlusion percentages. Four key insights emerge: (1) Transformer-based CLIP
models consistently outperform CNNs, (2) fine-grained, dispersed occlusions
degrade performance more than larger contiguous occlusions, (3) despite
improved accuracy, performance of linear-probed models sharply drops at around
35% occlusion, (4) by finetuning the model's backbone, this performance drop
occurs at more than 60% occlusion. These results underscore the importance of
occlusion-specific augmentations during training and the need for further
exploration into patch-level sensitivity and architectural resilience for
real-world deployment of CLIP.

Motivation: 当前视频内容理解技术能够识别具体实体，但在抽象概念识别方面仍面临挑战。人类具有识别正义、自由、团结等抽象概念的能力，而自动化理解高级抽象概念对使模型更符合人类理解和价值观至关重要

Method: 通过综述性研究方法，评估了不同的抽象概念识别任务和数据集，分析了历史上的研究试验，并建议在多模态基础模型时代利用过往经验来解决这一挑战

Result: 研究发现学术界在长期内不断尝试解决抽象概念识别问题，但需要统一的评估标准和更好的方法。多模态基础模型为这一领域提供了新的机遇

Conclusion: 这篇综述强调了利用多模态基础模型时代的优势来重新定义和解决视频抽象概念识别挑战的重要性，并建议继承历史经验以避免重复开发，从而推动这一重要领域的进步

Abstract: The automatic understanding of video content is advancing rapidly. Empowered
by deeper neural networks and large datasets, machines are increasingly capable
of understanding what is concretely visible in video frames, whether it be
objects, actions, events, or scenes. In comparison, humans retain a unique
ability to also look beyond concrete entities and recognize abstract concepts
like justice, freedom, and togetherness. Abstract concept recognition forms a
crucial open challenge in video understanding, where reasoning on multiple
semantic levels based on contextual information is key. In this paper, we argue
that the recent advances in foundation models make for an ideal setting to
address abstract concept understanding in videos. Automated understanding of
high-level abstract concepts is imperative as it enables models to be more
aligned with human reasoning and values. In this survey, we study different
tasks and datasets used to understand abstract concepts in video content. We
observe that, periodically and over a long period, researchers have attempted
to solve these tasks, making the best use of the tools available at their
disposal. We advocate that drawing on decades of community experience will help
us shed light on this important open grand challenge and avoid ``re-inventing
the wheel'' as we start revisiting it in the era of multi-modal foundation
models.

Motivation: 虽然皮肤病变分类模型的准确度已超过皮肤科医生，但医学实践中对AI模型的不信任仍是挑战，需要可信豖、可解释的诊断结果

Method: 提出Global Class Activation Probabilistic Map Evaluation方法，在像素级别概率化分析所有类别的激活概率地图，统一可视化诊断过程，并结合SafeML检测假阶断

Result: 方法在ISIC数据集上使用MobileNetV2和Vision Transformers进行了评估

Conclusion: 该方法能够减少误诊风险，提高诊断的可靠性和病人安全性

Abstract: Recent advancements in skin lesion classification models have significantly
improved accuracy, with some models even surpassing dermatologists' diagnostic
performance. However, in medical practice, distrust in AI models remains a
challenge. Beyond high accuracy, trustworthy, explainable diagnoses are
essential. Existing explainability methods have reliability issues, with
LIME-based methods suffering from inconsistency, while CAM-based methods
failing to consider all classes. To address these limitations, we propose
Global Class Activation Probabilistic Map Evaluation, a method that analyses
all classes' activation probability maps probabilistically and at a pixel
level. By visualizing the diagnostic process in a unified manner, it helps
reduce the risk of misdiagnosis. Furthermore, the application of SafeML
enhances the detection of false diagnoses and issues warnings to doctors and
patients as needed, improving diagnostic reliability and ultimately patient
safety. We evaluated our method using the ISIC datasets with MobileNetV2 and
Vision Transformers.

TL;DR: 本文探讨扩散分类器在组合泛化能力方面是否优于判别式模型（如CLIP和ViLT），特别是在属性绑定和关系推理任务上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言语义的核心是能够从已知部分组合出新含义，但现有的视觉语言模型（如CLIP）在处理组合语义时表现不佳，容易出现概念混淆错误。扩散模型在生成任务中表现出色，需要验证其在组合泛化方面的能力。

Method: 评估三种模型（扩散分类器、CLIP和ViLT）在零样本学习（ZSL）和广义零样本学习（GZSL）设置下的属性绑定和关系推理能力，分析CLIP嵌入表示来探究困难根源。

Result: 扩散分类器和ViLT在概念绑定任务上表现良好，但所有模型在关系GZSL任务上都显著困难。CLIP嵌入分析表明，关系概念（如左右）的表示过于相似可能是困难的原因。

Conclusion: 虽然扩散分类器在组合泛化方面有所改进，但所有视觉语言模型在关系推理方面都面临重大挑战，需要进一步研究来解决表示相似性问题。

Abstract: A fundamental aspect of the semantics of natural language is that novel
meanings can be formed from the composition of previously known parts.
Vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant progress in recent years,
however, there is evidence that they are unable to perform this kind of
composition. For example, given an image of a red cube and a blue cylinder, a
VLM such as CLIP is likely to incorrectly label the image as a red cylinder or
a blue cube, indicating it represents the image as a `bag-of-words' and fails
to capture compositional semantics. Diffusion models have recently gained
significant attention for their impressive generative abilities, and zero-shot
classifiers based on diffusion models have been shown to perform competitively
with CLIP in certain compositional tasks. In this work we explore whether the
generative Diffusion Classifier has improved compositional generalisation
abilities compared to discriminative models. We assess three models --
Diffusion Classifier, CLIP, and ViLT -- on their ability to bind objects with
attributes and relations in both zero-shot learning (ZSL) and generalised
zero-shot learning (GZSL) settings. Our results show that the Diffusion
Classifier and ViLT perform well at concept binding tasks, but that all models
struggle significantly with the relational GZSL task, underscoring the broader
challenges VLMs face with relational reasoning. Analysis of CLIP embeddings
suggests that the difficulty may stem from overly similar representations of
relational concepts such as left and right. Code and dataset are available at:

Motivation: 现有点云配准方法忽略点方向和点不确定性，对噪声输入和激进旋转敏感，需要大量带变换增强的训练数据。

Method: 使用虚拟透视相机参数从Lidar点云初始化surfel，通过SE(3)等变卷积核学习显式等变特征，包含等变卷积编码器、交叉注意力机制、全连接解码器和Huber损失函数。

Result: 在室内外数据集上验证了模型优越性，相比最先进方法在真实点云扫描上表现出更鲁棒的性能。

Conclusion: 提出的surfel-based方法能够有效处理点云配准中的噪声和旋转问题，具有更好的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Point cloud registration is crucial for ensuring 3D alignment consistency of
multiple local point clouds in 3D reconstruction for remote sensing or digital
heritage. While various point cloud-based registration methods exist, both
non-learning and learning-based, they ignore point orientations and point
uncertainties, making the model susceptible to noisy input and aggressive
rotations of the input point cloud like orthogonal transformation; thus, it
necessitates extensive training point clouds with transformation augmentations.
To address these issues, we propose a novel surfel-based pose learning
regression approach. Our method can initialize surfels from Lidar point cloud
using virtual perspective camera parameters, and learns explicit
$\mathbf{SE(3)}$ equivariant features, including both position and rotation
through $\mathbf{SE(3)}$ equivariant convolutional kernels to predict relative
transformation between source and target scans. The model comprises an
equivariant convolutional encoder, a cross-attention mechanism for similarity
computation, a fully-connected decoder, and a non-linear Huber loss.
Experimental results on indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrate our model
superiority and robust performance on real point-cloud scans compared to
state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 现有龋齿检测方法由于对比度变化细微和病变形态多样导致准确率不佳，需要模拟牙医结合整体筛查和局部检查的临床工作流程。

Method: 使用自动牙齿检测建立全局全景视图和局部牙齿裁剪视图，分别预训练视觉基础模型，通过门控跨视图注意力模块动态融合双视图特征。

Conclusion: DVCTNet通过双视图协同训练有效提升了龋齿检测性能，为临床诊断提供了可靠工具。

Abstract: Accurate dental caries detection from panoramic X-rays plays a pivotal role
in preventing lesion progression. However, current detection methods often
yield suboptimal accuracy due to subtle contrast variations and diverse lesion
morphology of dental caries. In this work, inspired by the clinical workflow
where dentists systematically combine whole-image screening with detailed
tooth-level inspection, we present DVCTNet, a novel Dual-View Co-Training
network for accurate dental caries detection. Our DVCTNet starts with employing
automated tooth detection to establish two complementary views: a global view
from panoramic X-ray images and a local view from cropped tooth images. We then
pretrain two vision foundation models separately on the two views. The
global-view foundation model serves as the detection backbone, generating
region proposals and global features, while the local-view model extracts
detailed features from corresponding cropped tooth patches matched by the
region proposals. To effectively integrate information from both views, we
introduce a Gated Cross-View Attention (GCV-Atten) module that dynamically
fuses dual-view features, enhancing the detection pipeline by integrating the
fused features back into the detection model for final caries detection. To
rigorously evaluate our DVCTNet, we test it on a public dataset and further
validate its performance on a newly curated, high-precision dental caries
detection dataset, annotated using both intra-oral images and panoramic X-rays
for double verification. Experimental results demonstrate DVCTNet's superior
performance against existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on both datasets,
indicating the clinical applicability of our method. Our code and labeled
dataset are available at https://github.com/ShanghaiTech-IMPACT/DVCTNet.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了FusionCounting框架，将可见光-红外图像融合与人群计数结合，通过多任务学习和动态损失权重策略，在提升图像融合质量的同时实现更好的人群计数性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VIF方法主要关注图像质量优化，虽然近期研究开始结合语义分割和目标检测等下游任务，但这些方法需要大量标注或在高密度场景中面临边界框重叠和遮挡问题。RGB-T人群计数虽然受到关注但尚未与VIF整合。

Method: 提出多任务学习框架FusionCounting，将人群计数集成到VIF过程中，利用人群密度信息进行相互促进的多任务设计。采用动态损失函数权重策略加速收敛和平衡任务贡献，并引入对抗训练增强模型鲁棒性。

Result: 在公开数据集上的实验结果表明，FusionCounting不仅提升了图像融合质量，还实现了更优越的人群计数性能。

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了高密度场景中VIF与人群计数的整合问题，通过最小化标注需求实现了两个任务的协同提升，为多模态视觉任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Most visible and infrared image fusion (VIF) methods focus primarily on
optimizing fused image quality. Recent studies have begun incorporating
downstream tasks, such as semantic segmentation and object detection, to
provide semantic guidance for VIF. However, semantic segmentation requires
extensive annotations, while object detection, despite reducing annotation
efforts compared with segmentation, faces challenges in highly crowded scenes
due to overlapping bounding boxes and occlusion. Moreover, although RGB-T crowd
counting has gained increasing attention in recent years, no studies have
integrated VIF and crowd counting into a unified framework. To address these
challenges, we propose FusionCounting, a novel multi-task learning framework
that integrates crowd counting into the VIF process. Crowd counting provides a
direct quantitative measure of population density with minimal annotation,
making it particularly suitable for dense scenes. Our framework leverages both
input images and population density information in a mutually beneficial
multi-task design. To accelerate convergence and balance tasks contributions,
we introduce a dynamic loss function weighting strategy. Furthermore, we
incorporate adversarial training to enhance the robustness of both VIF and
crowd counting, improving the model's stability and resilience to adversarial
attacks. Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate that
FusionCounting not only enhances image fusion quality but also achieves
superior crowd counting performance.

Method: 设计提示语库创建指令微调数据集，使用LoRA技术对VLM进行细调，将视觉特征与语义关键点描述对齐

Result: 仅细调2个epoch，调整后的VLM就超过了基线模型，在低资源场景中显示了有效性

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提高了2D关键点检测性能，为下一步的3D手术手和工具姿态估计研究奠定了基础

Abstract: This paper presents a novel pipeline for 2D keypoint estima- tion of surgical
tools by leveraging Vision Language Models (VLMs) fine- tuned using a low rank
adjusting (LoRA) technique. Unlike traditional Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) or Transformer-based approaches, which often suffer from overfitting in
small-scale medical datasets, our method harnesses the generalization
capabilities of pre-trained VLMs. We carefully design prompts to create an
instruction-tuning dataset and use them to align visual features with semantic
keypoint descriptions. Experimental results show that with only two epochs of
fine tuning, the adapted VLM outperforms the baseline models, demonstrating the
ef- fectiveness of LoRA in low-resource scenarios. This approach not only
improves keypoint detection performance, but also paves the way for future work
in 3D surgical hands and tools pose estimation.

Conclusion: 这个工作首次将RWKV架构成功应用于点云分类域通用问题，通过两个关键模块有效解决了空间扩弄和波动挑战，保持了RWKV的线性效率优势，为点云处理领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Domain Generalization (DG) has been recently explored to enhance the
generalizability of Point Cloud Classification (PCC) models toward unseen
domains. Prior works are based on convolutional networks, Transformer or Mamba
architectures, either suffering from limited receptive fields or high
computational cost, or insufficient long-range dependency modeling. RWKV, as an
emerging architecture, possesses superior linear complexity, global receptive
fields, and long-range dependency. In this paper, we present the first work
that studies the generalizability of RWKV models in DG PCC. We find that
directly applying RWKV to DG PCC encounters two significant challenges: RWKV's
fixed direction token shift methods, like Q-Shift, introduce spatial
distortions when applied to unstructured point clouds, weakening local
geometric modeling and reducing robustness. In addition, the Bi-WKV attention
in RWKV amplifies slight cross-domain differences in key distributions through
exponential weighting, leading to attention shifts and degraded generalization.
To this end, we propose PointDGRWKV, the first RWKV-based framework tailored
for DG PCC. It introduces two key modules to enhance spatial modeling and
cross-domain robustness, while maintaining RWKV's linear efficiency. In
particular, we present Adaptive Geometric Token Shift to model local
neighborhood structures to improve geometric context awareness. In addition,
Cross-Domain key feature Distribution Alignment is designed to mitigate
attention drift by aligning key feature distributions across domains. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that PointDGRWKV achieves
state-of-the-art performance on DG PCC.

Abstract: Deep learning based automated pathological diagnosis has markedly improved
diagnostic efficiency and reduced variability between observers, yet its
clinical adoption remains limited by opaque model decisions and a lack of
traceable rationale. To address this, recent multimodal visual reasoning
architectures provide a unified framework that generates segmentation masks at
the pixel level alongside semantically aligned textual explanations. By
localizing lesion regions and producing expert style diagnostic narratives,
these models deliver the transparent and interpretable insights necessary for
dependable AI assisted pathology. Building on these advancements, we propose
PathMR, a cell-level Multimodal visual Reasoning framework for Pathological
image analysis. Given a pathological image and a textual query, PathMR
generates expert-level diagnostic explanations while simultaneously predicting
cell distribution patterns. To benchmark its performance, we evaluated our
approach on the publicly available PathGen dataset as well as on our newly
developed GADVR dataset. Extensive experiments on these two datasets
demonstrate that PathMR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art visual
reasoning methods in text generation quality, segmentation accuracy, and
cross-modal alignment. These results highlight the potential of PathMR for
improving interpretability in AI-driven pathological diagnosis. The code will

Conclusion: 建立了一个强大的自动化PDAC检测流程，可增强病理学家能力，并为扩展到其他癌症类型提供基础，同时为小规模医学影像数据集深度学习应用提供了宝贵见解

Abstract: Pacreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains one of the most lethal forms
of cancer, with a five-year survival rate below 10% primarily due to late
detection. This research develops and validates a deep learning framework for
early PDAC detection through analysis of dual-modality imaging:
autofluorescence and second harmonic generation (SHG). We analyzed 40 unique
patient samples to create a specialized neural network capable of
distinguishing between normal, fibrotic, and cancerous tissue. Our methodology
evaluated six distinct deep learning architectures, comparing traditional
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with modern Vision Transformers (ViTs).
Through systematic experimentation, we identified and overcome significant
challenges in medical image analysis, including limited dataset size and class
imbalance. The final optimized framework, based on a modified ResNet
architecture with frozen pre-trained layers and class-weighted training,
achieved over 90% accuracy in cancer detection. This represents a significant
improvement over current manual analysis methods an demonstrates potential for
clinical deployment. This work establishes a robust pipeline for automated PDAC
detection that can augment pathologists' capabilities while providing a
foundation for future expansion to other cancer types. The developed
methodology also offers valuable insights for applying deep learning to
limited-size medical imaging datasets, a common challenge in clinical
applications.

Conclusion: 模块化因果推理框架通过可解释的中间表征显著提升了视频QA的性能和可信度，CCE可作为可重用的因果推理引擎

Abstract: Existing Causal-Why Video Question Answering (VideoQA) models often struggle
with higher-order reasoning, relying on opaque, monolithic pipelines that
entangle video understanding, causal inference, and answer generation. These
black-box approaches offer limited interpretability and tend to depend on
shallow heuristics. We propose a novel, modular framework that explicitly
decouples causal reasoning from answer generation, introducing natural language
causal chains as interpretable intermediate representations. Inspired by human
cognitive models, these structured cause-effect sequences bridge low-level
video content with high-level causal reasoning, enabling transparent and
logically coherent inference. Our two-stage architecture comprises a Causal
Chain Extractor (CCE) that generates causal chains from video-question pairs,
and a Causal Chain-Driven Answerer (CCDA) that produces answers grounded in
these chains. To address the lack of annotated reasoning traces, we introduce a
scalable method for generating high-quality causal chains from existing
datasets using large language models. We also propose CauCo, a new evaluation
metric for causality-oriented captioning. Experiments on three large-scale
benchmarks demonstrate that our approach not only outperforms state-of-the-art
models, but also yields substantial gains in explainability, user trust, and
generalization -- positioning the CCE as a reusable causal reasoning engine
across diverse domains. Project page:

Abstract: Counterfactual reasoning -- the practice of asking ``what if'' by varying
inputs and observing changes in model behavior -- has become central to
interpretable and fair AI. This thesis develops frameworks that use
counterfactuals to explain, audit, and mitigate bias in vision classifiers and
generative models. By systematically altering semantically meaningful
attributes while holding others fixed, these methods uncover spurious
correlations, probe causal dependencies, and help build more robust systems.
  The first part addresses vision classifiers. CAVLI integrates attribution
(LIME) with concept-level analysis (TCAV) to quantify how strongly decisions
rely on human-interpretable concepts. With localized heatmaps and a Concept
Dependency Score, CAVLI shows when models depend on irrelevant cues like
backgrounds. Extending this, ASAC introduces adversarial counterfactuals that
perturb protected attributes while preserving semantics. Through curriculum
learning, ASAC fine-tunes biased models for improved fairness and accuracy
while avoiding stereotype-laden artifacts.
  The second part targets generative Text-to-Image (TTI) models. TIBET provides
a scalable pipeline for evaluating prompt-sensitive biases by varying
identity-related terms, enabling causal auditing of how race, gender, and age
affect image generation. To capture interactions, BiasConnect builds causal
graphs diagnosing intersectional biases. Finally, InterMit offers a modular,
training-free algorithm that mitigates intersectional bias via causal
sensitivity scores and user-defined fairness goals.
  Together, these contributions show counterfactuals as a unifying lens for
interpretability, fairness, and causality in both discriminative and generative
models, establishing principled, scalable methods for socially responsible bias
evaluation and mitigation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FW-GAN是一个基于频率感知的单样本手写合成框架，通过Wave-MLP和频率引导判别器生成高质量的风格一致手写文本，解决了传统方法在长距离依赖和频率信息建模方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决手写识别中标注数据稀缺问题，当前方法存在两个主要限制：传统卷积架构难以建模长距离依赖和复杂笔画模式，以及忽视频率信息在捕捉细粒度风格细节中的关键作用。

Method: 提出FW-GAN框架，包含相位感知Wave-MLP生成器来捕捉空间关系并保留风格线索，频率引导判别器利用高频成分增强真实性检测，以及新颖的频率分布损失来对齐合成与真实手写的频率特征。

Result: 在越南语和英语手写数据集上的实验表明，FW-GAN能够生成高质量、风格一致的手写文本，有效提升低资源手写识别系统的数据增强能力。

Conclusion: FW-GAN通过频率感知方法显著提升了手写合成的真实性和风格一致性，为低资源手写识别提供了有价值的数据增强工具。

Abstract: Labeled handwriting data is often scarce, limiting the effectiveness of
recognition systems that require diverse, style-consistent training samples.
Handwriting synthesis offers a promising solution by generating artificial data
to augment training. However, current methods face two major limitations.
First, most are built on conventional convolutional architectures, which
struggle to model long-range dependencies and complex stroke patterns. Second,
they largely ignore the crucial role of frequency information, which is
essential for capturing fine-grained stylistic and structural details in
handwriting. To address these challenges, we propose FW-GAN, a one-shot
handwriting synthesis framework that generates realistic, writer-consistent
text from a single example. Our generator integrates a phase-aware Wave-MLP to
better capture spatial relationships while preserving subtle stylistic cues. We
further introduce a frequency-guided discriminator that leverages
high-frequency components to enhance the authenticity detection of generated
samples. Additionally, we introduce a novel Frequency Distribution Loss that
aligns the frequency characteristics of synthetic and real handwriting, thereby
enhancing visual fidelity. Experiments on Vietnamese and English handwriting
datasets demonstrate that FW-GAN generates high-quality, style-consistent
handwriting, making it a valuable tool for augmenting data in low-resource
handwriting recognition (HTR) pipelines. Official implementation is available

Abstract: Foundation models pre-trained on large-scale natural image datasets offer a
powerful paradigm for medical image segmentation. However, effectively
transferring their learned representations for precise clinical applications
remains a challenge. In this work, we propose Dino U-Net, a novel
encoder-decoder architecture designed to exploit the high-fidelity dense
features of the DINOv3 vision foundation model. Our architecture introduces an
encoder built upon a frozen DINOv3 backbone, which employs a specialized
adapter to fuse the model's rich semantic features with low-level spatial
details. To preserve the quality of these representations during dimensionality
reduction, we design a new fidelity-aware projection module (FAPM) that
effectively refines and projects the features for the decoder. We conducted
extensive experiments on seven diverse public medical image segmentation
datasets. Our results show that Dino U-Net achieves state-of-the-art
performance, consistently outperforming previous methods across various imaging
modalities. Our framework proves to be highly scalable, with segmentation
accuracy consistently improving as the backbone model size increases up to the
7-billion-parameter variant. The findings demonstrate that leveraging the
superior, dense-pretrained features from a general-purpose foundation model
provides a highly effective and parameter-efficient approach to advance the
accuracy of medical image segmentation. The code is available at

Abstract: Mitotic figures (MFs) are relevant biomarkers in tumor grading.
Differentiating atypical MFs (AMFs) from normal MFs (NMFs) remains difficult,
as manual annotation is time-consuming and subjective. In this work an ensemble

refinement (RBR) module. On the MIDOG25 preliminary test set, the ensemble
achieved a balanced accuracy of 84.02%. While the RBR increased specificity, it
reduced sensitivity and overall performance. The results show that deep
ensembles perform well for AMF classification. RBR can increase specific
metrics but requires further research.

Abstract: Many high-performance networks were not designed with lightweight application
scenarios in mind from the outset, which has greatly restricted their scope of
application. This paper takes ConvNeXt as the research object and significantly
reduces the parameter scale and network complexity of ConvNeXt by integrating
the Cross Stage Partial Connections mechanism and a series of optimized
designs. The new network is named E-ConvNeXt, which can maintain high accuracy
performance under different complexity configurations. The three core
innovations of E-ConvNeXt are : (1) integrating the Cross Stage Partial Network
(CSPNet) with ConvNeXt and adjusting the network structure, which reduces the
model's network complexity by up to 80%; (2) Optimizing the Stem and Block
structures to enhance the model's feature expression capability and operational
efficiency; (3) Replacing Layer Scale with channel attention. Experimental
validation on ImageNet classification demonstrates E-ConvNeXt's superior
accuracy-efficiency balance: E-ConvNeXt-mini reaches 78.3% Top-1 accuracy at
0.9GFLOPs. E-ConvNeXt-small reaches 81.9% Top-1 accuracy at 3.1GFLOPs. Transfer

Conclusion: 通过网络数据利用和自动注释技术，有效解决了图片置改定位的数据缺乏问题，大幅提升了模型性能，为该领域提供了可靠的数据支撑

Abstract: Images manipulated using image editing tools can mislead viewers and pose
significant risks to social security. However, accurately localizing the
manipulated regions within an image remains a challenging problem. One of the
main barriers in this area is the high cost of data acquisition and the severe
lack of high-quality annotated datasets. To address this challenge, we
introduce novel methods that mitigate data scarcity by leveraging readily
available web data. We utilize a large collection of manually forged images
from the web, as well as automatically generated annotations derived from a
simpler auxiliary task, constrained image manipulation localization.
Specifically, we introduce a new paradigm CAAAv2, which automatically and
accurately annotates manipulated regions at the pixel level. To further improve
annotation quality, we propose a novel metric, QES, which filters out
unreliable annotations. Through CAAA v2 and QES, we construct MIMLv2, a
large-scale, diverse, and high-quality dataset containing 246,212 manually
forged images with pixel-level mask annotations. This is over 120x larger than
existing handcrafted datasets like IMD20. Additionally, we introduce Object
Jitter, a technique that further enhances model training by generating
high-quality manipulation artifacts. Building on these advances, we develop a
new model, Web-IML, designed to effectively leverage web-scale supervision for
the image manipulation localization task. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our approach substantially alleviates the data scarcity problem and
significantly improves the performance of various models on multiple real-world
forgery benchmarks. With the proposed web supervision, Web-IML achieves a
striking performance gain of 31% and surpasses previous SOTA TruFor by 24.1
average IoU points. The dataset and code will be made publicly available at

Abstract: Simulating detector responses is a crucial part of understanding the inner
workings of particle collisions in the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. Such
simulations are currently performed with statistical Monte Carlo methods, which
are computationally expensive and put a significant strain on CERN's
computational grid. Therefore, recent proposals advocate for generative machine
learning methods to enable more efficient simulations. However, the
distribution of the data varies significantly across the simulations, which is
hard to capture with out-of-the-box methods. In this study, we present
ExpertSim - a deep learning simulation approach tailored for the Zero Degree
Calorimeter in the ALICE experiment. Our method utilizes a
Mixture-of-Generative-Experts architecture, where each expert specializes in
simulating a different subset of the data. This allows for a more precise and
efficient generation process, as each expert focuses on a specific aspect of
the calorimeter response. ExpertSim not only improves accuracy, but also
provides a significant speedup compared to the traditional Monte-Carlo methods,
offering a promising solution for high-efficiency detector simulations in
particle physics experiments at CERN. We make the code available at

Conclusion: POSE成功解决了大规模视频扩散模型的采样效率瓶颈，实现了高质量单步视频生成，为实时视频生成应用提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: The field of video diffusion generation faces critical bottlenecks in
sampling efficiency, especially for large-scale models and long sequences.
Existing video acceleration methods adopt image-based techniques but suffer
from fundamental limitations: they neither model the temporal coherence of
video frames nor provide single-step distillation for large-scale video models.
To bridge this gap, we propose POSE (Phased One-Step Equilibrium), a
distillation framework that reduces the sampling steps of large-scale video
diffusion models, enabling the generation of high-quality videos in a single
step. POSE employs a carefully designed two-phase process to distill video
models:(i) stability priming: a warm-up mechanism to stabilize adversarial
distillation that adapts the high-quality trajectory of the one-step generator
from high to low signal-to-noise ratio regimes, optimizing the video quality of
single-step mappings near the endpoints of flow trajectories. (ii) unified
adversarial equilibrium: a flexible self-adversarial distillation mechanism
that promotes stable single-step adversarial training towards a Nash
equilibrium within the Gaussian noise space, generating realistic single-step
videos close to real videos. For conditional video generation, we propose (iii)
conditional adversarial consistency, a method to improve both semantic
consistency and frame consistency between conditional frames and generated
frames. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that POSE outperforms other
acceleration methods on VBench-I2V by average 7.15% in semantic alignment,
temporal conference and frame quality, reducing the latency of the pre-trained
model by 100$\times$, from 1000 seconds to 10 seconds, while maintaining
competitive performance.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models enable high-quality image generation but are
computationally expensive. While prior work optimizes per-inference efficiency,
we explore an orthogonal approach: reducing redundancy across correlated
prompts. Our method leverages the coarse-to-fine nature of diffusion models,
where early denoising steps capture shared structures among similar prompts. We
propose a training-free approach that clusters prompts based on semantic
similarity and shares computation in early diffusion steps. Experiments show
that for models trained conditioned on image embeddings, our approach
significantly reduces compute cost while improving image quality. By leveraging
UnClip's text-to-image prior, we enhance diffusion step allocation for greater
efficiency. Our method seamlessly integrates with existing pipelines, scales
with prompt sets, and reduces the environmental and financial burden of
large-scale text-to-image generation. Project page:

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频大语言模型的视觉token过多导致计算效率低下，现有方法未考虑视频的动态特性和时间依赖性。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：1)基于帧相似性分割视频并动态分配token预算；2)使用时序引导的DPC算法联合建模帧间独特性和帧内多样性。

Result: 在LLaVA-OneVision-7B上减少75%视觉token，预填充阶段加速3.9倍，同时保持99.5%的原始性能。

Conclusion: MMG-Vid能最大化有限token预算的利用率，在显著提升效率的同时保持强性能表现。

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VLLMs) excel in video understanding, but their
excessive visual tokens pose a significant computational challenge for
real-world applications. Current methods aim to enhance inference efficiency by
visual token pruning. However, they do not consider the dynamic characteristics
and temporal dependencies of video frames, as they perceive video understanding
as a multi-frame task. To address these challenges, we propose MMG-Vid, a novel
training-free visual token pruning framework that removes redundancy by
Maximizing Marginal Gains at both segment-level and token-level. Specifically,
we first divide the video into segments based on frame similarity, and then
dynamically allocate the token budget for each segment to maximize the marginal
gain of each segment. Subsequently, we propose a temporal-guided DPC algorithm
that jointly models inter-frame uniqueness and intra-frame diversity, thereby
maximizing the marginal gain of each token. By combining both stages, MMG-Vid
can maximize the utilization of the limited token budget, significantly
improving efficiency while maintaining strong performance. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MMG-Vid can maintain over 99.5% of the original
performance, while effectively reducing 75% visual tokens and accelerating the
prefilling stage by 3.9x on LLaVA-OneVision-7B. Code will be released soon.

TL;DR: 提出了HydraFake数据集模拟真实世界深度伪造检测挑战，并开发了基于多模态大语言模型的Veritas检测器，通过模式感知推理实现更好的泛化性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有学术基准与工业实践存在严重差异，训练源同质化且测试图像质量低，阻碍了检测器的实际部署

Method: 构建分层泛化测试的HydraFake数据集；提出基于MLLM的Veritas检测器，采用模式感知推理（规划和自我反思）模拟人类取证过程；设计两阶段训练流程

Result: 在HydraFake数据集上，先前检测器在跨模型场景表现良好但在未见伪造和数据域上不足；Veritas在不同OOD场景中取得显著提升，能提供透明可信的检测输出

Conclusion: HydraFake数据集有效模拟真实世界挑战，Veritas检测器通过模式感知推理实现了更好的泛化能力和透明检测

Abstract: Deepfake detection remains a formidable challenge due to the complex and
evolving nature of fake content in real-world scenarios. However, existing
academic benchmarks suffer from severe discrepancies from industrial practice,
typically featuring homogeneous training sources and low-quality testing
images, which hinder the practical deployments of current detectors. To
mitigate this gap, we introduce HydraFake, a dataset that simulates real-world
challenges with hierarchical generalization testing. Specifically, HydraFake
involves diversified deepfake techniques and in-the-wild forgeries, along with
rigorous training and evaluation protocol, covering unseen model architectures,
emerging forgery techniques and novel data domains. Building on this resource,
we propose Veritas, a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) based deepfake
detector. Different from vanilla chain-of-thought (CoT), we introduce
pattern-aware reasoning that involves critical reasoning patterns such as
"planning" and "self-reflection" to emulate human forensic process. We further
propose a two-stage training pipeline to seamlessly internalize such deepfake
reasoning capacities into current MLLMs. Experiments on HydraFake dataset
reveal that although previous detectors show great generalization on
cross-model scenarios, they fall short on unseen forgeries and data domains.
Our Veritas achieves significant gains across different OOD scenarios, and is
capable of delivering transparent and faithful detection outputs.

TL;DR: FakeParts是一种新型深度伪造技术，通过局部区域或时间段进行细微修改，比传统深度伪造更具欺骗性。研究提出了首个大规模基准数据集FakePartsBench，包含2.5万+视频，用于检测方法评估。实验显示人类和现有检测模型的识别准确率下降30%以上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度伪造检测主要针对完全合成内容，但局部细微修改的伪造视频更具欺骗性且难以检测，存在检测能力空白。

Method: 提出FakeParts局部深度伪造概念，构建首个大规模基准数据集FakePartsBench（包含2.5万+视频，提供像素级和帧级标注），通过用户研究和模型测试评估检测效果。

Result: FakeParts使人类检测准确率相比传统深度伪造下降30%以上，现有最先进检测模型也出现类似性能下降。

Conclusion: 这项工作揭示了当前深度伪造检测方法的严重漏洞，为开发更鲁棒的局部视频篡改检测方法提供了必要资源。

Abstract: We introduce FakeParts, a new class of deepfakes characterized by subtle,
localized manipulations to specific spatial regions or temporal segments of
otherwise authentic videos. Unlike fully synthetic content, these partial
manipulations, ranging from altered facial expressions to object substitutions
and background modifications, blend seamlessly with real elements, making them
particularly deceptive and difficult to detect. To address the critical gap in
detection capabilities, we present FakePartsBench, the first large-scale
benchmark dataset specifically designed to capture the full spectrum of partial
deepfakes. Comprising over 25K videos with pixel-level and frame-level
manipulation annotations, our dataset enables comprehensive evaluation of
detection methods. Our user studies demonstrate that FakeParts reduces human
detection accuracy by over 30% compared to traditional deepfakes, with similar
performance degradation observed in state-of-the-art detection models. This
work identifies an urgent vulnerability in current deepfake detection
approaches and provides the necessary resources to develop more robust methods
for partial video manipulations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单目追踪器遇到深度歧义和遮挡问题，而传统多摄像头方法需要过多摄像头和每序列优化，实用性很差

Method: 使用4个摄像头，将多视图特征融合成统一点云，采用k近邻相关和变换器更新模型来预测3D对应关系，适应遮挡情况

Result: 在Panoptic Studio和DexYCB实际数据集上分别达到中位轨迹误差3.1cm和2.0cm，支持1-8个视角和24-150帧视频长度的多样化摄像头配置

Conclusion: 该方法为多视角3D追踪研究设定了新标准，提供了一个实用的实际应用工具，并开源了训练和评估数据集

Abstract: We introduce the first data-driven multi-view 3D point tracker, designed to
track arbitrary points in dynamic scenes using multiple camera views. Unlike
existing monocular trackers, which struggle with depth ambiguities and
occlusion, or prior multi-camera methods that require over 20 cameras and
tedious per-sequence optimization, our feed-forward model directly predicts 3D
correspondences using a practical number of cameras (e.g., four), enabling
robust and accurate online tracking. Given known camera poses and either
sensor-based or estimated multi-view depth, our tracker fuses multi-view
features into a unified point cloud and applies k-nearest-neighbors correlation
alongside a transformer-based update to reliably estimate long-range 3D
correspondences, even under occlusion. We train on 5K synthetic multi-view
Kubric sequences and evaluate on two real-world benchmarks: Panoptic Studio and
DexYCB, achieving median trajectory errors of 3.1 cm and 2.0 cm, respectively.
Our method generalizes well to diverse camera setups of 1-8 views with varying
vantage points and video lengths of 24-150 frames. By releasing our tracker
alongside training and evaluation datasets, we aim to set a new standard for
multi-view 3D tracking research and provide a practical tool for real-world
applications. Project page available at https://ethz-vlg.github.io/mvtracker.

TL;DR: OneReward是一个统一的强化学习框架，使用单一奖励模型提升多任务生成能力，在图像编辑任务中超越商业和开源竞争对手。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多任务生成方法通常需要针对特定任务进行监督微调(SFT)，这限制了模型的泛化能力和训练效率。不同任务虽然共享相同的条件范式，但在数据分布和评估指标上差异显著。

Method: 使用单一视觉语言模型(VLM)作为生成奖励模型，能够区分给定任务和评估标准下的优劣结果。基于OneReward开发了Seedream 3.0 Fill模型，通过多任务强化学习直接在预训练基础模型上训练，无需任务特定的SFT。

Result: 实验结果表明，统一的编辑模型在多个评估维度上 consistently 优于Ideogram、Adobe Photoshop和FLUX Fill [Pro]等商业和开源竞争对手。

Conclusion: OneReward框架证明了使用单一奖励模型可以有效提升多任务生成能力，特别是在具有多样化数据和任务目标的场景中，为多任务生成模型提供了高效的训练解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce OneReward, a unified reinforcement learning
framework that enhances the model's generative capabilities across multiple
tasks under different evaluation criteria using only \textit{One Reward} model.
By employing a single vision-language model (VLM) as the generative reward
model, which can distinguish the winner and loser for a given task and a given
evaluation criterion, it can be effectively applied to multi-task generation
models, particularly in contexts with varied data and diverse task objectives.
We utilize OneReward for mask-guided image generation, which can be further
divided into several sub-tasks such as image fill, image extend, object
removal, and text rendering, involving a binary mask as the edit area. Although
these domain-specific tasks share same conditioning paradigm, they differ
significantly in underlying data distributions and evaluation metrics. Existing
methods often rely on task-specific supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which limits
generalization and training efficiency. Building on OneReward, we develop
Seedream 3.0 Fill, a mask-guided generation model trained via multi-task
reinforcement learning directly on a pre-trained base model, eliminating the
need for task-specific SFT. Experimental results demonstrate that our unified
edit model consistently outperforms both commercial and open-source
competitors, such as Ideogram, Adobe Photoshop, and FLUX Fill [Pro], across
multiple evaluation dimensions. Code and model are available at:

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试现有水印技术对对抗攻击的鲁棒性，推动更强大水印方法的发展

Method: 白盒跟踪使用自适应VAE规避攻击，结合测试时优化和CIELAB色彩空间恢复；黑盒跟踪通过图像聚类，应用扩散模型和ChatGPT生成的语义先验进行水印移除

Result: 实现了近完美的水印移除效果（95.7%），对剩余图像质量影响极小

Conclusion: 该方法成功展示了现有水印技术的脆弱性，希望激励开发更鲁棒的水印方案

Abstract: Content watermarking is an important tool for the authentication and
copyright protection of digital media. However, it is unclear whether existing
watermarks are robust against adversarial attacks. We present the winning
solution to the NeurIPS 2024 Erasing the Invisible challenge, which
stress-tests watermark robustness under varying degrees of adversary knowledge.
The challenge consisted of two tracks: a black-box and beige-box track,
depending on whether the adversary knows which watermarking method was used by
the provider. For the beige-box track, we leverage an adaptive VAE-based
evasion attack, with a test-time optimization and color-contrast restoration in
CIELAB space to preserve the image's quality. For the black-box track, we first
cluster images based on their artifacts in the spatial or frequency-domain.
Then, we apply image-to-image diffusion models with controlled noise injection
and semantic priors from ChatGPT-generated captions to each cluster with
optimized parameter settings. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our method
successfully achieves near-perfect watermark removal (95.7%) with negligible
impact on the residual image's quality. We hope that our attacks inspire the
development of more robust image watermarking methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决协作机器人在动态人类环境中安全高效运行的挑战，传统控制器假设完全可见性和固定工具，导致碰撞风险或过于保守的行为。

Method: 使用学习感知模型过滤点云中的机器人和工具组件，推理遮挡区域，在部分可观测性下预测碰撞，通过约束强化学习训练控制策略生成平滑避障动作。

Result: 在仿真和真实测试中优于传统方法（APF、MPPI），保持亚毫米级精度，计算成本比最先进GPU规划器降低约60%，响应时间低于10毫秒。

Conclusion: 该方法为动态环境中的机器人提供了模块化、高效且有效的碰撞避免解决方案，成功集成到协作机器人应用中，实现安全响应操作。

Abstract: Ensuring safe and efficient operation of collaborative robots in human
environments is challenging, especially in dynamic settings where both obstacle
motion and tasks change over time. Current robot controllers typically assume
full visibility and fixed tools, which can lead to collisions or overly
conservative behavior. In our work, we introduce a tool-aware collision
avoidance system that adjusts in real time to different tool sizes and modes of
tool-environment interaction. Using a learned perception model, our system
filters out robot and tool components from the point cloud, reasons about
occluded area, and predicts collision under partial observability. We then use
a control policy trained via constrained reinforcement learning to produce
smooth avoidance maneuvers in under 10 milliseconds. In simulated and
real-world tests, our approach outperforms traditional approaches (APF, MPPI)
in dynamic environments, while maintaining sub-millimeter accuracy. Moreover,
our system operates with approximately 60% lower computational cost compared to
a state-of-the-art GPU-based planner. Our approach provides modular, efficient,
and effective collision avoidance for robots operating in dynamic environments.
We integrate our method into a collaborative robot application and demonstrate
its practical use for safe and responsive operation.

Motivation: 现有方法无法在保持提示性的同时实现低延迟推理，动态物体的实时交互抓取合成仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 扩展SAMv2模型用于视频流抓取估计，整合用户提示与时空上下文信息，确保动态物体的时间一致性。

Result: 在OCID上达到90.6%的实例级抓取准确率，Jacquard上93.8%，GraspNet-1Billion上92.0%，延迟降低58.5%，真实世界实验中94.8%的成功率。

Conclusion: SPGrasp有效解决了动态抓取合成中的延迟与交互性权衡问题，实现了实时交互抓取。

Abstract: Real-time interactive grasp synthesis for dynamic objects remains challenging
as existing methods fail to achieve low-latency inference while maintaining
promptability. To bridge this gap, we propose SPGrasp (spatiotemporal
prompt-driven dynamic grasp synthesis), a novel framework extending segment
anything model v2 (SAMv2) for video stream grasp estimation. Our core
innovation integrates user prompts with spatiotemporal context, enabling
real-time interaction with end-to-end latency as low as 59 ms while ensuring
temporal consistency for dynamic objects. In benchmark evaluations, SPGrasp
achieves instance-level grasp accuracies of 90.6% on OCID and 93.8% on
Jacquard. On the challenging GraspNet-1Billion dataset under continuous
tracking, SPGrasp achieves 92.0% accuracy with 73.1 ms per-frame latency,
representing a 58.5% reduction compared to the prior state-of-the-art
promptable method RoG-SAM while maintaining competitive accuracy. Real-world
experiments involving 13 moving objects demonstrate a 94.8% success rate in
interactive grasping scenarios. These results confirm SPGrasp effectively
resolves the latency-interactivity trade-off in dynamic grasp synthesis. Code

Motivation: 剪切力在动态物体交互任务中至关重要，但由于难以在仿真中准确建模剪切动力学，限制了仿真到现实触觉控制的应用。

Method: 提出shPix2pix（剪切条件U-Net GAN），将无剪切信息的仿真触觉图像与剪切编码向量结合，生成包含剪切变形的真实触觉图像。使用低成本桌面机械臂和视觉触觉传感器进行验证。

Result: 在触觉图像仿真和姿态/剪切预测方面优于基线pix2pix方法。在触觉跟踪和协作举升任务中，接触误差保持在1-2毫米范围内。

Conclusion: 该方法验证了使用刚体仿真器进行仿真到现实剪切建模的可行性，为触觉机器人仿真开辟了新方向。

Abstract: We present SimShear, a sim-to-real pipeline for tactile control that enables
the use of shear information without explicitly modeling shear dynamics in
simulation. Shear, arising from lateral movements across contact surfaces, is
critical for tasks involving dynamic object interactions but remains
challenging to simulate. To address this, we introduce shPix2pix, a
shear-conditioned U-Net GAN that transforms simulated tactile images absent of
shear, together with a vector encoding shear information, into realistic
equivalents with shear deformations. This method outperforms baseline pix2pix
approaches in simulating tactile images and in pose/shear prediction. We apply
SimShear to two control tasks using a pair of low-cost desktop robotic arms
equipped with a vision-based tactile sensor: (i) a tactile tracking task, where
a follower arm tracks a surface moved by a leader arm, and (ii) a collaborative
co-lifting task, where both arms jointly hold an object while the leader
follows a prescribed trajectory. Our method maintains contact errors within 1
to 2 mm across varied trajectories where shear sensing is essential, validating
the feasibility of sim-to-real shear modeling with rigid-body simulators and
opening new directions for simulation in tactile robotics.

Conclusion: 该结构化步态接口实现了透明分析和低摩擦的仿真到现实迁移，为双足机器人窄梁行走提供了可靠解决方案

Abstract: Traversing narrow beams is challenging for humanoids due to sparse,
safety-critical contacts and the fragility of purely learned policies. We
propose a physically grounded, two-stage framework that couples an XCoM/LIPM
footstep template with a lightweight residual planner and a simple low-level
tracker. Stage-1 is trained on flat ground: the tracker learns to robustly
follow footstep targets by adding small random perturbations to heuristic
footsteps, without any hand-crafted centerline locking, so it acquires stable
contact scheduling and strong target-tracking robustness. Stage-2 is trained in
simulation on a beam: a high-level planner predicts a body-frame residual
(Delta x, Delta y, Delta psi) for the swing foot only, refining the template
step to prioritize safe, precise placement under narrow support while
preserving interpretability. To ease deployment, sensing is kept minimal and
consistent between simulation and hardware: the planner consumes compact,
forward-facing elevation cues together with onboard IMU and joint signals. On a
Unitree G1, our system reliably traverses a 0.2 m-wide, 3 m-long beam. Across
simulation and real-world studies, residual refinement consistently outperforms
template-only and monolithic baselines in success rate, centerline adherence,
and safety margins, while the structured footstep interface enables transparent
analysis and low-friction sim-to-real transfer.

Abstract: Real-time human-device interaction in industrial Metaverse faces challenges
such as high computational load, limited bandwidth, and strict latency. This
paper proposes a task-oriented edge-assisted cross-system framework using
digital twins (DTs) to enable responsive interactions. By predicting operator
motions, the system supports: 1) proactive Metaverse rendering for visual
feedback, and 2) preemptive control of remote devices. The DTs are decoupled
into two virtual functions-visual display and robotic control-optimizing both
performance and adaptability. To enhance generalizability, we introduce the
Human-In-The-Loop Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (HITL-MAML) algorithm, which
dynamically adjusts prediction horizons. Evaluation on two tasks demonstrates
the framework's effectiveness: in a Trajectory-Based Drawing Control task, it
reduces weighted RMSE from 0.0712 m to 0.0101 m; in a real-time 3D scene
representation task for nuclear decommissioning, it achieves a PSNR of 22.11,
SSIM of 0.8729, and LPIPS of 0.1298. These results show the framework's
capability to ensure spatial precision and visual fidelity in real-time,

Abstract: Decreasing skilled workers is a very serious problem in the world. To deal
with this problem, the skill transfer from experts to robots has been
researched. These methods which teach robots by human motion are called
imitation learning. Experts' skills generally appear in not only position data,
but also force data. Thus, position and force data need to be saved and
reproduced. To realize this, a lot of research has been conducted in the
framework of a motion-copying system. Recent research uses machine learning
methods to generate motion commands. However, most of them could not change
tasks by following human intention. Some of them can change tasks by
conditional training, but the labels are limited. Thus, we propose the flexible
motion translation method by using Generative Adversarial Networks. The
proposed method enables users to teach robots tasks by inputting data, and
skills by a trained model. We evaluated the proposed system with a 3-DOF
calligraphy robot.

Abstract: To enable flexible, high-throughput automation in settings where people and
robots share workspaces, collaborative robotic cells must reconcile stringent
safety guarantees with the need for responsive and effective behavior. A
dynamic obstacle is the stochastic, task-dependent variability of human motion:
when robots fall back on purely reactive or worst-case envelopes, they brake
unnecessarily, stall task progress, and tamper with the fluidity that true
Human-Robot Interaction demands. In recent years, learning-based human-motion
prediction has rapidly advanced, although most approaches produce worst-case
scenario forecasts that often do not treat prediction uncertainty in a
well-structured way, resulting in over-conservative planning algorithms,
limiting their flexibility. We introduce Uncertainty-Aware Predictive Control
Barrier Functions (UA-PCBFs), a unified framework that fuses probabilistic
human hand motion forecasting with the formal safety guarantees of Control
Barrier Functions. In contrast to other variants, our framework allows for
dynamic adjustment of the safety margin thanks to the human motion uncertainty
estimation provided by a forecasting module. Thanks to uncertainty estimation,
UA-PCBFs empower collaborative robots with a deeper understanding of future
human states, facilitating more fluid and intelligent interactions through
informed motion planning. We validate UA-PCBFs through comprehensive real-world
experiments with an increasing level of realism, including automated setups (to
perform exactly repeatable motions) with a robotic hand and direct human-robot
interactions (to validate promptness, usability, and human confidence).
Relative to state-of-the-art HRI architectures, UA-PCBFs show better
performance in task-critical metrics, significantly reducing the number of
violations of the robot's safe space during interaction with respect to the
state-of-the-art.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel fabric-based thermal-haptic interface for virtual
reality and teleoperation. It integrates pneumatic actuation and conductive
fabric with an innovative ultra-lightweight design, achieving only 2~g for each
finger unit. By embedding heating elements within textile pneumatic chambers,
the system delivers modulated pressure and thermal stimuli to fingerpads
through a fully soft, wearable interface.
  Comprehensive characterization demonstrates rapid thermal modulation with
heating rates up to 3$^{\circ}$C/s, enabling dynamic thermal feedback for
virtual or teleoperation interactions. The pneumatic subsystem generates forces
up to 8.93~N at 50~kPa, while optimization of fingerpad-actuator clearance
enhances cooling efficiency with minimal force reduction. Experimental
validation conducted with two different user studies shows high temperature
identification accuracy (0.98 overall) across three thermal levels, and
significant manipulation improvements in a virtual pick-and-place tasks.
Results show enhanced success rates (88.5\% to 96.4\%, p = 0.029) and improved
force control precision (p = 0.013) when haptic feedback is enabled, validating
the effectiveness of the integrated thermal-haptic approach for advanced
human-machine interaction applications.

Motivation: 解决基于视频生成的具身世界模型对大规模交互数据的依赖问题，以及长时程视频生成的挑战，通过利用原始动作空间的有限性来提升数据效率和模型性能

Method: 提出Primitive Embodied World Models (PEWM)，限制视频生成为固定短时程，结合模块化Vision-Language Model规划器和Start-Goal heatmap Guidance机制

Conclusion: 该框架利用视频模型的时空视觉先验和VLM的语义感知能力，弥合细粒度物理交互与高层推理之间的差距，为可扩展、可解释的通用具身智能铺平道路

Abstract: While video-generation-based embodied world models have gained increasing
attention, their reliance on large-scale embodied interaction data remains a
key bottleneck. The scarcity, difficulty of collection, and high dimensionality
of embodied data fundamentally limit the alignment granularity between language
and actions and exacerbate the challenge of long-horizon video
generation--hindering generative models from achieving a "GPT moment" in the
embodied domain. There is a naive observation: the diversity of embodied data
far exceeds the relatively small space of possible primitive motions. Based on
this insight, we propose a novel paradigm for world modeling--Primitive
Embodied World Models (PEWM). By restricting video generation to fixed short
horizons, our approach 1) enables fine-grained alignment between linguistic
concepts and visual representations of robotic actions, 2) reduces learning
complexity, 3) improves data efficiency in embodied data collection, and 4)
decreases inference latency. By equipping with a modular Vision-Language Model
(VLM) planner and a Start-Goal heatmap Guidance mechanism (SGG), PEWM further
enables flexible closed-loop control and supports compositional generalization
of primitive-level policies over extended, complex tasks. Our framework
leverages the spatiotemporal vision priors in video models and the semantic
awareness of VLMs to bridge the gap between fine-grained physical interaction
and high-level reasoning, paving the way toward scalable, interpretable, and
general-purpose embodied intelligence.

Conclusion: GIT*通过充分利用多种环境数据和强化遗传编程，显著提升了高维路径规划的性能，为复杂环境下的最优路径规划提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Optimal path planning involves finding a feasible state sequence between a
start and a goal that optimizes an objective. This process relies on heuristic
functions to guide the search direction. While a robust function can improve
search efficiency and solution quality, current methods often overlook
available environmental data and simplify the function structure due to the
complexity of information relationships. This study introduces Genetic Informed
Trees (GIT*), which improves upon Effort Informed Trees (EIT*) by integrating a
wider array of environmental data, such as repulsive forces from obstacles and
the dynamic importance of vertices, to refine heuristic functions for better
guidance. Furthermore, we integrated reinforced genetic programming (RGP),
which combines genetic programming with reward system feedback to mutate
genotype-generative heuristic functions for GIT*. RGP leverages a multitude of
data types, thereby improving computational efficiency and solution quality
within a set timeframe. Comparative analyses demonstrate that GIT* surpasses
existing single-query, sampling-based planners in problems ranging from R^4 to
R^16 and was tested on a real-world mobile manipulation task. A video

Abstract: Efficient motion planning algorithms are essential in robotics. Optimizing
essential parameters, such as batch size and nearest neighbor selection in
sampling-based methods, can enhance performance in the planning process.
However, existing approaches often lack environmental adaptability. Inspired by
the method of the deep fuzzy neural networks, this work introduces
Learning-based Informed Trees (LIT*), a sampling-based deep fuzzy
learning-based planner that dynamically adjusts batch size and nearest neighbor
parameters to obstacle distributions in the configuration spaces. By encoding
both global and local ratios via valid and invalid states, LIT* differentiates
between obstacle-sparse and obstacle-dense regions, leading to lower-cost paths
and reduced computation time. Experimental results in high-dimensional spaces
demonstrate that LIT* achieves faster convergence and improved solution
quality. It outperforms state-of-the-art single-query, sampling-based planners
in environments ranging from R^8 to R^14 and is successfully validated on a
dual-arm robot manipulation task. A video showcasing our experimental results

Abstract: Collaborative learning enhances the performance and adaptability of
multi-robot systems in complex tasks but faces significant challenges due to
high communication overhead and data heterogeneity inherent in multi-robot
tasks. To this end, we propose CoCoL, a Communication efficient decentralized
Collaborative Learning method tailored for multi-robot systems with
heterogeneous local datasets. Leveraging a mirror descent framework, CoCoL
achieves remarkable communication efficiency with approximate Newton-type
updates by capturing the similarity between objective functions of robots, and
reduces computational costs through inexact sub-problem solutions. Furthermore,
the integration of a gradient tracking scheme ensures its robustness against
data heterogeneity. Experimental results on three representative multi robot
collaborative learning tasks show the superiority of the proposed CoCoL in
significantly reducing both the number of communication rounds and total
bandwidth consumption while maintaining state-of-the-art accuracy. These
benefits are particularly evident in challenging scenarios involving non-IID
(non-independent and identically distributed) data distribution, streaming
data, and time-varying network topologies.

Result: 在Isaac Sim中的综合评估显示，GODHS相比传统非语义搜索策略具有更高的搜索效率

Conclusion: 该框架成功整合了语义感知和空间推理，为机器人在复杂非结构化环境中的高效物体搜索提供了可行解决方案

Abstract: Enabling robots to efficiently search for and identify objects in complex,
unstructured environments is critical for diverse applications ranging from
household assistance to industrial automation. However, traditional scene
representations typically capture only static semantics and lack interpretable
contextual reasoning, limiting their ability to guide object search in
completely unfamiliar settings. To address this challenge, we propose a
language-enhanced hierarchical navigation framework that tightly integrates
semantic perception and spatial reasoning. Our method, Goal-Oriented
Dynamically Heuristic-Guided Hierarchical Search (GODHS), leverages large
language models (LLMs) to infer scene semantics and guide the search process
through a multi-level decision hierarchy. Reliability in reasoning is achieved
through the use of structured prompts and logical constraints applied at each
stage of the hierarchy. For the specific challenges of mobile manipulation, we
introduce a heuristic-based motion planner that combines polar angle sorting
with distance prioritization to efficiently generate exploration paths.
Comprehensive evaluations in Isaac Sim demonstrate the feasibility of our
framework, showing that GODHS can locate target objects with higher search
efficiency compared to conventional, non-semantic search strategies. Website

Abstract: Scaling tactile sensing for robust whole-body manipulation is a significant
challenge, often limited by wiring complexity, data throughput, and system
reliability. This paper presents a complete architecture designed to overcome
these barriers. Our approach pairs open-source, fabric-based sensors with
custom readout electronics that reduce signal crosstalk to less than 3.3%
through hardware-based mitigation. Critically, we introduce a novel,
daisy-chained SPI bus topology that avoids the practical limitations of common
wireless protocols and the prohibitive wiring complexity of USB hub-based
systems. This architecture streams synchronized data from over 8,000 taxels
across 1 square meter of sensing area at update rates exceeding 50 FPS,
confirming its suitability for real-time control. We validate the system's
efficacy in a whole-body grasping task where, without feedback, the robot's
open-loop trajectory results in an uncontrolled application of force that
slowly crushes a deformable cardboard box. With real-time tactile feedback, the
robot transforms this motion into a gentle, stable grasp, successfully
manipulating the object without causing structural damage. This work provides a
robust and well-characterized platform to enable future research in advanced
whole-body control and physical human-robot interaction.

Result: 在单视角选择和完整轨迹规划任务上都达到了最先进的性能

Conclusion: ActLoc的模块化设计使其能够广泛应用于各种机器人导航和检测任务，有效提升了定位的鲁棒性

Abstract: Reliable localization is critical for robot navigation, yet most existing
systems implicitly assume that all viewing directions at a location are equally
informative. In practice, localization becomes unreliable when the robot
observes unmapped, ambiguous, or uninformative regions. To address this, we
present ActLoc, an active viewpoint-aware planning framework for enhancing
localization accuracy for general robot navigation tasks. At its core, ActLoc
employs a largescale trained attention-based model for viewpoint selection. The
model encodes a metric map and the camera poses used during map construction,
and predicts localization accuracy across yaw and pitch directions at arbitrary
3D locations. These per-point accuracy distributions are incorporated into a
path planner, enabling the robot to actively select camera orientations that
maximize localization robustness while respecting task and motion constraints.
ActLoc achieves stateof-the-art results on single-viewpoint selection and
generalizes effectively to fulltrajectory planning. Its modular design makes it
readily applicable to diverse robot navigation and inspection tasks.

Abstract: Visuotactile sensors provide high-resolution tactile information but are
incapable of perceiving the material features of objects. We present UltraTac,
an integrated sensor that combines visuotactile imaging with ultrasound sensing
through a coaxial optoacoustic architecture. The design shares structural
components and achieves consistent sensing regions for both modalities.
Additionally, we incorporate acoustic matching into the traditional
visuotactile sensor structure, enabling integration of the ultrasound sensing
modality without compromising visuotactile performance. Through tactile
feedback, we dynamically adjust the operating state of the ultrasound module to
achieve flexible functional coordination. Systematic experiments demonstrate
three key capabilities: proximity sensing in the 3-8 cm range ($R^2=0.90$),
material classification (average accuracy: 99.20%), and texture-material
dual-mode object recognition achieving 92.11% accuracy on a 15-class task.
Finally, we integrate the sensor into a robotic manipulation system to
concurrently detect container surface patterns and internal content, which
verifies its potential for advanced human-machine interaction and precise
robotic manipulation.

Abstract: With robots increasingly operating in human-centric environments, ensuring
soft and safe physical interactions, whether with humans, surroundings, or
other machines, is essential. While compliant hardware can facilitate such
interactions, this work focuses on impedance controllers that allow
torque-controlled robots to safely and passively respond to contact while
accurately executing tasks. From inverse dynamics to quadratic
programming-based controllers, the effectiveness of these methods relies on
accurate dynamics models of the robot and the object it manipulates. Any model
mismatch results in task failures and unsafe behaviors. Thus, we introduce
Rapid Mismatch Estimation (RME), an adaptive, controller-agnostic,
probabilistic framework that estimates end-effector dynamics mismatches online,
without relying on external force-torque sensors. From the robot's
proprioceptive feedback, a Neural Network Model Mismatch Estimator generates a
prior for a Variational Inference solver, which rapidly converges to the
unknown parameters while quantifying uncertainty. With a real 7-DoF manipulator
driven by a state-of-the-art passive impedance controller, RME adapts to sudden
changes in mass and center of mass at the end-effector in $\sim400$ ms, in
static and dynamic settings. We demonstrate RME in a collaborative scenario
where a human attaches an unknown basket to the robot's end-effector and
dynamically adds/removes heavy items, showcasing fast and safe adaptation to
changing dynamics during physical interaction without any external sensory
system.

Abstract: Humanoid robots have recently achieved impressive progress in locomotion and
whole-body control, yet they remain constrained in tasks that demand rapid
interaction with dynamic environments through manipulation. Table tennis
exemplifies such a challenge: with ball speeds exceeding 5 m/s, players must
perceive, predict, and act within sub-second reaction times, requiring both
agility and precision. To address this, we present a hierarchical framework for
humanoid table tennis that integrates a model-based planner for ball trajectory
prediction and racket target planning with a reinforcement learning-based
whole-body controller. The planner determines striking position, velocity and
timing, while the controller generates coordinated arm and leg motions that
mimic human strikes and maintain stability and agility across consecutive
rallies. Moreover, to encourage natural movements, human motion references are
incorporated during training. We validate our system on a general-purpose
humanoid robot, achieving up to 106 consecutive shots with a human opponent and
sustained exchanges against another humanoid. These results demonstrate
real-world humanoid table tennis with sub-second reactive control, marking a
step toward agile and interactive humanoid behaviors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决控制策略从模拟到实际运行的转移困难（sim-to-real gap），现有方法要么无法处理分布外条件，要么需要程序调试。

Method: 统一残差动力学习与实时策略适应的在线适应性学习框架，利用可微分模拟实现梯度传播，通过实际数据持续精炼动力学模型。

Result: 在四旋翼飞行器控制中，比L1-MPC减少至81%的悬停误差，比DATT减少55%，并在无显式状态估计的视觉基础控制中体现了稳健性。

Abstract: Learning control policies in simulation enables rapid, safe, and
cost-effective development of advanced robotic capabilities. However,
transferring these policies to the real world remains difficult due to the
sim-to-real gap, where unmodeled dynamics and environmental disturbances can
degrade policy performance. Existing approaches, such as domain randomization
and Real2Sim2Real pipelines, can improve policy robustness, but either struggle
under out-of-distribution conditions or require costly offline retraining. In
this work, we approach these problems from a different perspective. Instead of
relying on diverse training conditions before deployment, we focus on rapidly
adapting the learned policy in the real world in an online fashion. To achieve
this, we propose a novel online adaptive learning framework that unifies
residual dynamics learning with real-time policy adaptation inside a
differentiable simulation. Starting from a simple dynamics model, our framework
refines the model continuously with real-world data to capture unmodeled
effects and disturbances such as payload changes and wind. The refined dynamics
model is embedded in a differentiable simulation framework, enabling gradient
backpropagation through the dynamics and thus rapid, sample-efficient policy
updates beyond the reach of classical RL methods like PPO. All components of
our system are designed for rapid adaptation, enabling the policy to adjust to
unseen disturbances within 5 seconds of training. We validate the approach on
agile quadrotor control under various disturbances in both simulation and the
real world. Our framework reduces hovering error by up to 81% compared to
L1-MPC and 55% compared to DATT, while also demonstrating robustness in
vision-based control without explicit state estimation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CrystalICL是一个基于大语言模型的少样本晶体生成模型，通过空间群晶体标记化方法和条件-结构感知混合指令调优框架，在四个基准测试中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的晶体生成方法仅限于零样本场景，无法利用少样本学习。而人类专家通常通过修改相关已知结构来设计新材料，这与少样本ICL范式高度契合。

Method: 提出空间群晶体标记化方法降低晶体对称性建模复杂度；设计条件-结构感知混合指令调优框架和多任务指令调优策略，从有限数据中捕捉结构-性能关系。

Result: 在四个晶体生成基准测试中，CrystalICL在条件生成和无条件生成任务上都优于领先的基线方法。

Conclusion: CrystalICL成功实现了少样本晶体生成，通过创新的标记化和指令调优方法有效提升了LLM在材料设计中的ICL能力。

Abstract: Designing crystal materials with desired physicochemical properties remains a
fundamental challenge in materials science. While large language models (LLMs)
have demonstrated strong in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, existing
LLM-based crystal generation approaches are limited to zero-shot scenarios and
are unable to benefit from few-shot scenarios. In contrast, human experts
typically design new materials by modifying relevant known structures which
aligns closely with the few-shot ICL paradigm. Motivated by this, we propose
CrystalICL, a novel model designed for few-shot crystal generation.
Specifically, we introduce a space-group based crystal tokenization method,
which effectively reduces the complexity of modeling crystal symmetry in LLMs.
We further introduce a condition-structure aware hybrid instruction tuning
framework and a multi-task instruction tuning strategy, enabling the model to
better exploit ICL by capturing structure-property relationships from limited
data. Extensive experiments on four crystal generation benchmarks demonstrate
the superiority of CrystalICL over the leading baseline methods on conditional
and unconditional generation tasks.

Abstract: Transformer-based models are at the forefront in long time-series forecasting
(LTSF). While in many cases, these models are able to achieve state of the art
results, they suffer from a bias toward low-frequencies in the data and high
computational and memory requirements. Recent work has established that
learnable frequency filters can be an integral part of a deep forecasting model
by enhancing the model's spectral utilization. These works choose to use a
multilayer perceptron to process their filtered signals and thus do not solve
the issues found with transformer-based models. In this paper, we establish
that adding a filter to the beginning of transformer-based models enhances
their performance in long time-series forecasting. We add learnable filters,
which only add an additional $\approx 1000$ parameters to several
transformer-based models and observe in multiple instances 5-10 \% relative
improvement in forecasting performance. Additionally, we find that with filters
added, we are able to decrease the embedding dimension of our models, resulting
in transformer-based architectures that are both smaller and more effective
than their non-filtering base models. We also conduct synthetic experiments to
analyze how the filters enable Transformer-based models to better utilize the
full spectrum for forecasting.

Result: 建立了从Wiener线性预测器到transformer非线性预测器的概念聚合，并通过概率角度给予了理论解释。

Conclusion: 该研究成功地将经典滤波理论与现代深度学习架构相结合，为transformer提供了新的理论基础和解释框架。

Abstract: In the 1940s, Wiener introduced a linear predictor, where the future
prediction is computed by linearly combining the past data. A transformer
generalizes this idea: it is a nonlinear predictor where the next-token
prediction is computed by nonlinearly combining the past tokens. In this essay,
we present a probabilistic model that interprets transformer signals as
surrogates of conditional measures, and layer operations as fixed-point
updates. An explicit form of the fixed-point update is described for the
special case when the probabilistic model is a hidden Markov model (HMM). In
part, this paper is in an attempt to bridge the classical nonlinear filtering
theory with modern inference architectures.

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) has emerged as an effective model compression
technique in deep learning, enabling the transfer of knowledge from a large
teacher model to a compact student model. While KD has demonstrated significant
success, it is not yet fully understood which factors contribute to improving
the student's performance. In this paper, we reveal a strong correlation
between the teacher's calibration error and the student's accuracy. Therefore,
we claim that the calibration of the teacher model is an important factor for
effective KD. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the performance of KD can be
improved by simply employing a calibration method that reduces the teacher's
calibration error. Our algorithm is versatile, demonstrating effectiveness
across various tasks from classification to detection. Moreover, it can be
easily integrated with existing state-of-the-art methods, consistently
achieving superior performance.

Motivation: 深度学习模型在实时或资源受限场景下面临可扩展性挑战，需要高效的核心集选择方法来减少训练数据量同时保持模型性能。

Method: 提出CLD（损失差异相关性）指标，通过测量训练样本损失与验证集损失轨迹的对齐程度来选择核心集，仅需训练检查点的逐样本损失值，避免梯度计算。

Result: 在CIFAR-100和ImageNet-1k上，CLD通常优于或接近最先进方法，与计算昂贵的基线方法相差不到1%。可跨架构迁移，使用早期检查点时稳定，并具有内在偏差减少特性。

Conclusion: CLD是一种原则性、高效、稳定且可迁移的数据集优化工具，适用于可扩展的深度学习训练。

Abstract: Deep learning models achieve state-of-the-art performance across domains but
face scalability challenges in real-time or resource-constrained scenarios. To
address this, we propose Correlation of Loss Differences (CLD), a simple and
scalable metric for coreset selection that identifies the most impactful
training samples by measuring their alignment with the loss trajectories of a
held-out validation set. CLD is highly efficient, requiring only per-sample
loss values computed at training checkpoints, and avoiding the costly gradient
and curvature computations used in many existing subset selection methods. We
develop a general theoretical framework that establishes convergence guarantees
for CLD-based coresets, demonstrating that the convergence error is
upper-bounded by the alignment of the selected samples and the
representativeness of the validation set. On CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1k,
CLD-based coresets typically outperform or closely match state-of-the-art
methods across subset sizes, and remain within 1% of more computationally
expensive baselines even when not leading. CLD transfers effectively across
architectures (ResNet, VGG, DenseNet), enabling proxy-to-target selection with
<1% degradation. Moreover, CLD is stable when using only early checkpoints,
incurring negligible accuracy loss. Finally, CLD exhibits inherent bias
reduction via per-class validation alignment, obviating the need for additional
stratified sampling. Together, these properties make CLD a principled,
efficient, stable, and transferable tool for scalable dataset optimization.

Abstract: We present an analysis of the transductive node classification problem, where
the underlying graph consists of communities that agree with the node labels
and node features. For node classification, we propose a novel optimization
problem that incorporates the node-specific information (labels and features)
in a spectral graph clustering framework. Studying this problem, we demonstrate
a synergy between the graph structure and node-specific information. In
particular, we show that suitable node-specific information guarantees the
solution of our optimization problem perfectly recovering the communities,
under milder conditions than the bounds on graph clustering alone. We present
algorithmic solutions to our optimization problem and numerical experiments
that confirm such a synergy.

Conclusion: INS2ANE框架展示了自主实验在增强科学发现深度方面的潜力，结合自主实验提供的效率，有望通过同时导航复杂实验空间来加速科学研究

Abstract: Autonomous experiments (AEs) are transforming how scientific research is
conducted by integrating artificial intelligence with automated experimental
platforms. Current AEs primarily focus on the optimization of a predefined
target; while accelerating this goal, such an approach limits the discovery of
unexpected or unknown physical phenomena. Here, we introduce a novel framework,
INS2ANE (Integrated Novelty Score-Strategic Autonomous Non-Smooth Exploration),
to enhance the discovery of novel phenomena in autonomous experimentation. Our
method integrates two key components: (1) a novelty scoring system that
evaluates the uniqueness of experimental results, and (2) a strategic sampling
mechanism that promotes exploration of under-sampled regions even if they
appear less promising by conventional criteria. We validate this approach on a
pre-acquired dataset with a known ground truth comprising of image-spectral
pairs. We further implement the process on autonomous scanning probe microscopy
experiments. INS2ANE significantly increases the diversity of explored
phenomena in comparison to conventional optimization routines, enhancing the
likelihood of discovering previously unobserved phenomena. These results
demonstrate the potential for AE to enhance the depth of scientific discovery;
in combination with the efficiency provided by AEs, this approach promises to
accelerate scientific research by simultaneously navigating complex
experimental spaces to uncover new phenomena.

Abstract: The process of discovering equations from data lies at the heart of physics
and in many other areas of research, including mathematical ecology and
epidemiology. Recently, machine learning methods known as symbolic regression
have automated this process. As several methods are available in the
literature, it is important to compare them, particularly for dynamic systems
that describe complex phenomena. In this paper, five symbolic regression
methods were used for recovering equations from nine dynamical processes,
including chaotic dynamics and epidemic models, with the PySR method proving to
be the most suitable for inferring equations. Benchmark results demonstrate its
high predictive power and accuracy, with some estimates being indistinguishable
from the original analytical forms. These results highlight the potential of
symbolic regression as a robust tool for inferring and modelling real-world

Abstract: Latent variable models provide a powerful framework for incorporating and
inferring unobserved factors in observational data. In causal inference, they
help account for hidden factors influencing treatment or outcome, thereby
addressing challenges posed by missing or unmeasured covariates. This paper
proposes a new framework that integrates latent variable modeling into the
double machine learning (DML) paradigm to enable robust causal effect
estimation in the presence of such hidden factors. We consider two scenarios:
one where a latent variable affects only the outcome, and another where it may
influence both treatment and outcome. To ensure tractability, we incorporate
latent variables only in the second stage of DML, separating representation
learning from latent inference. We demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness
of our method through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world
datasets.

Abstract: Although traditional statistical techniques and machine learning methods have
contributed significantly to genetics and, in particular, inherited disease

now addressed by state-of-the-art deep learning models. Large language models
(LLMs), based on transformer architectures, have excelled in tasks requiring
contextual comprehension of unstructured medical data. This systematic review
examines the role of LLMs in the genetic research and diagnostics of both rare
and common diseases. Automated keyword-based search in PubMed, bioRxiv,
medRxiv, and arXiv was conducted, targeting studies on LLM applications in
diagnostics and education within genetics and removing irrelevant or outdated
models. A total of 172 studies were analyzed, highlighting applications in
genomic variant identification, annotation, and interpretation, as well as
medical imaging advancements through vision transformers. Key findings indicate
that while transformer-based models significantly advance disease and risk
stratification, variant interpretation, medical imaging analysis, and report
generation, major challenges persist in integrating multimodal data (genomic
sequences, imaging, and clinical records) into unified and clinically robust
pipelines, facing limitations in generalizability and practical implementation
in clinical settings. This review provides a comprehensive classification and
assessment of the current capabilities and limitations of LLMs in transforming
hereditary disease diagnostics and supporting genetic education, serving as a

Abstract: This paper introduce a novel metric of an objective function f, we say VC
(value change) to measure the difficulty and approximation affection when
conducting an neural network approximation task, and it numerically supports
characterizing the local performance and behavior of neural network
approximation. Neural networks often suffer from unpredictable local
performance, which can hinder their reliability in critical applications. VC
addresses this issue by providing a quantifiable measure of local value changes
in network behavior, offering insights into the stability and performance for
achieving the neural-network approximation. We investigate some fundamental
theoretical properties of VC and identified two intriguing phenomena in neural
network approximation: the VC-tendency and the minority-tendency. These trends
respectively characterize how pointwise errors evolve in relation to the
distribution of VC during the approximation process.In addition, we propose a
novel metric based on VC, which measures the distance between two functions
from the perspective of variation. Building upon this metric, we further
propose a new preprocessing framework for neural network approximation.
Numerical results including the real-world experiment and the PDE-related
scientific problem support our discovery and pre-processing acceleration
method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的逐通道后训练量化方法通常需要通过启发式调优或网格搜索来固定缩放因子，这个过程需要手动操作且效率低下。

Method: Beacon使用固定的非缩放字母表直接执行逐通道PTQ，通过对称标量量化的几何特性自动确定最优缩放因子，支持对称和非对称量化，不依赖反向传播或大型校准集。

Result: 尽管算法简单且无需调优，Beacon在性能上与最先进的方法相比具有竞争力。

Conclusion: Beacon为高效模型部署提供了一个实用的解决方案，消除了手动调优的需求，同时保持了良好的量化性能。

Abstract: Quantization is a widely used compression technique for reducing the memory
and computation costs of large pre-trained models. A key challenge in
per-channel post-training quantization (PTQ) is selecting appropriate scaling
factors to replace weight values with values from a scaled quantization grid.
Existing methods typically fix the scale at the outset via heuristic tuning or
grid search. In this note, we propose Beacon, a simple and effective algorithm
that eliminates the need for such manual tuning. Beacon performs per-channel
PTQ directly using a fixed non-scaled alphabet and automatically determines the
optimal scaling factors by exploiting the geometry of symmetric scalar
quantization. It supports both symmetric and asymmetric quantization with
minimal modifications and does not rely on back-propagation or large
calibration sets. Despite its simplicity and tuning-free nature, Beacon
achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, making
it a practical solution for efficient model deployment.

Motivation: 解决现实世界强化学习中需要适应未见环境条件的问题，现有方法需要显式上下文变量，限制了在潜在或难以测量上下文情况下的应用。

Method: 在Dreamer架构中集成DALI框架，训练自监督编码器预测前向动力学，生成可操作的表征来调节世界模型和策略，连接感知和控制。

Result: 在挑战性cMDP基准测试中，DALI相比无上下文基线取得显著提升，在推断任务中经常超越有上下文基线，实现零样本泛化到未见上下文变化。

Conclusion: DALI通过潜在上下文推断和反事实一致性，为强化学习提供了强大的泛化能力，无需显式上下文信息即可适应新环境。

Abstract: Real-world reinforcement learning demands adaptation to unseen environmental
conditions without costly retraining. Contextual Markov Decision Processes
(cMDP) model this challenge, but existing methods often require explicit
context variables (e.g., friction, gravity), limiting their use when contexts
are latent or hard to measure. We introduce Dynamics-Aligned Latent Imagination
(DALI), a framework integrated within the Dreamer architecture that infers
latent context representations from agent-environment interactions. By training
a self-supervised encoder to predict forward dynamics, DALI generates
actionable representations conditioning the world model and policy, bridging
perception and control. We theoretically prove this encoder is essential for
efficient context inference and robust generalization. DALI's latent space
enables counterfactual consistency: Perturbing a gravity-encoding dimension
alters imagined rollouts in physically plausible ways. On challenging cMDP
benchmarks, DALI achieves significant gains over context-unaware baselines,
often surpassing context-aware baselines in extrapolation tasks, enabling
zero-shot generalization to unseen contextual variations.

Motivation: 解决ReFT在联邦学习中遇到的挑战：客户端数据分布、模型能力和计算资源的异质性，以及表征级更新在任务异质性下的聚合不匹配问题

Result: 在常识推理、算术推理、指令微调和GLUE任务上，FedReFT持续超越现有最优PEFT方法，参数效率比基于LoRA的方法高出7-15倍

Conclusion: FedReFT为联邦学习环境下的表征级精精调提供了高效解决方案，ABM聚合策略有效缓解了异质性带来的聚合挑战，在保持高参数效率的同时实现了优异的个性化学习效果

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has attracted significant attention
for adapting large pre-trained models by modifying a small subset of
parameters. Recently, Representation Fine-tuning (ReFT) has emerged as an
effective alternative. ReFT shifts the fine-tuning paradigm from updating model
weights to directly manipulating hidden representations that capture rich
semantic information, and performs better than state-of-the-art PEFTs in
standalone settings. However, its application in Federated Learning (FL)
remains challenging due to heterogeneity in clients' data distributions, model
capacities, and computational resources. To address these challenges, we
introduce Federated Representation Fine-Tuning (FedReFT), a novel approach to
fine-tune the client's hidden representation. FedReFT applies sparse
intervention layers to steer hidden representations directly, offering a
lightweight and semantically rich fine-tuning alternative ideal for edge
devices. However, representation-level updates are especially vulnerable to
aggregation mismatch under different task heterogeneity, where naive averaging
can corrupt semantic alignment. To mitigate this issue, we propose All-But-Me
(ABM) aggregation, where each client receives the aggregated updates of others
and partially incorporates them, enabling stable and personalized learning by
balancing local focus with global knowledge. We evaluate FedReFT on commonsense
reasoning, arithmetic reasoning, instruction-tuning, and GLUE, where it
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art PEFT methods in FL, achieving 7x-15x
higher parameter efficiency compared to leading LoRA-based approaches.

Method: 提出了结构化分类法，按协调模型和学习算法对MARL方法进行分类，涵盖基于价值、基于策略、行动者-评论者和通信增强框架等方法

Result: 全面综述了MARL在交通信号控制、网联自动驾驶车辆协调、物流优化和按需出行系统等关键ITS领域的应用，总结了常用仿真平台和基准测试

Conclusion: 尽管MARL在ITS中展现出巨大潜力，但可扩展性、非平稳性、信用分配、通信约束和仿真到现实的迁移差距等核心挑战仍然阻碍着实际部署

Abstract: The growing complexity of urban mobility and the demand for efficient,
sustainable, and adaptive solutions have positioned Intelligent Transportation
Systems (ITS) at the forefront of modern infrastructure innovation. At the core
of ITS lies the challenge of autonomous decision-making across dynamic, large
scale, and uncertain environments where multiple agents traffic signals,
autonomous vehicles, or fleet units must coordinate effectively. Multi Agent
Reinforcement Learning (MARL) offers a promising paradigm for addressing these
challenges by enabling distributed agents to jointly learn optimal strategies
that balance individual objectives with system wide efficiency. This paper
presents a comprehensive survey of MARL applications in ITS. We introduce a
structured taxonomy that categorizes MARL approaches according to coordination
models and learning algorithms, spanning value based, policy based, actor
critic, and communication enhanced frameworks. Applications are reviewed across
key ITS domains, including traffic signal control, connected and autonomous
vehicle coordination, logistics optimization, and mobility on demand systems.
Furthermore, we highlight widely used simulation platforms such as SUMO, CARLA,
and CityFlow that support MARL experimentation, along with emerging benchmarks.
The survey also identifies core challenges, including scalability, non
stationarity, credit assignment, communication constraints, and the sim to real
transfer gap, which continue to hinder real world deployment.

*Soo Hyun Kim,Jang-Hyun Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于邮件数据的双维度内部人才推荐框架，通过学习任务内容（WHAT）和协作模式（HOW）的最优融合比例来提高推荐准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统内部人才推荐方法存在结构性限制，容易忽略合格候选人，需要一种更全面的量化框架来减少人为偏见的影响。

Method: 使用双图卷积网络（Dual GCN）模型，将员工的任务内容和协作模式分别表示为独立图结构，通过门控机制进行自适应融合。

Result: 模型在Hit@100指标上达到40.9%的最高性能，显著超过其他融合策略和基准方法。模型还展现了高可解释性，能够根据不同职业类别学习不同的融合策略。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种量化且全面的内部人才发现框架，能够实证地确定任务对齐和协作模式之间的最优融合比例，为组织内部人才管理提供了重要的实践意义。

Abstract: Internal talent recommendation is a critical strategy for organizational
continuity, yet conventional approaches suffer from structural limitations,
often overlooking qualified candidates by relying on the narrow perspective of
a few managers. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework that
models two distinct dimensions of an employee's position fit from email data:
WHAT they do (semantic similarity of tasks) and HOW they work (structural
characteristics of their interactions and collaborations). These dimensions are
represented as independent graphs and adaptively fused using a Dual Graph
Convolutional Network (GCN) with a gating mechanism. Experiments show that our
proposed gating-based fusion model significantly outperforms other fusion
strategies and a heuristic baseline, achieving a top performance of 40.9% on
Hit@100. Importantly, it is worth noting that the model demonstrates high
interpretability by learning distinct, context-aware fusion strategies for
different job families. For example, it learned to prioritize relational (HOW)
data for 'sales and marketing' job families while applying a balanced approach
for 'research' job families. This research offers a quantitative and
comprehensive framework for internal talent discovery, minimizing the risk of
candidate omission inherent in traditional methods. Its primary contribution
lies in its ability to empirically determine the optimal fusion ratio between
task alignment (WHAT) and collaborative patterns (HOW), which is required for
employees to succeed in the new positions, thereby offering important practical
implications.

TL;DR: Forge是一种预训练方法，使用向量量化图自编码器在大量混合整数规划问题上进行无监督学习，无需依赖问题求解，可生成实例级嵌入表示用于下游任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于学习的方法需要为每个问题分布训练专用模型，计算开销大且泛化能力有限，需要一种更通用的预训练方法。

Method: 在大量多样的MIP实例上无监督预训练向量量化图自编码器，通过向量量化过程创建离散代码分配作为表示优化实例的词汇表。

Result: 无监督设置下，Forge嵌入能有效区分和聚类未见实例；有监督设置下，单个模型可预测多个问题类型的预热变量和整数间隙，提升商业求解器性能。

Conclusion: Forge提供了一种通用的MIP实例嵌入方法，支持无监督和有监督应用，显著提高了优化求解的效率和泛化能力。

Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems are ubiquitous in science and
engineering, yet learning-based approaches to accelerate their solution often
require solving a large number of hard-to-solve optimization instances to
collect training data, incurring significant computational overhead. Existing
methods require training dedicated models for each problem distribution for
each downstream task, severely limiting their scalability and generalization.
In this work, we introduce Forge, a method of pre-training a vector-quantized
graph autoencoder on a large and diverse collection of mixed-integer
programming (MIP) instances in an unsupervised fashion without dependency on
their solution. The vector quantization process creates discrete code
assignments that act as a vocabulary to represent optimization instances. We
evaluate our approach under both supervised and unsupervised settings. For the
unsupervised setting, we demonstrate that Forge embeddings effectively
differentiate and cluster unseen instances. For the supervised setting, we
fine-tune Forge embeddings and show that a single model predicts both the
variables for warm-starts and integrality gaps for cut-generation across
multiple problem type distributions. Both predictions help improve performance
of a state-of-the-art, commercial optimization solver. Finally, we release our
code and pre-trained Forge weights to encourage further research and practical
use of instance-level MIP embeddings at https://github.com/skadio/forge/

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Subversive Alignment Injection (SAI)的投毒攻击方法，通过利用LLM的对齐机制，在特定主题上触发拒绝回答，从而植入偏见或实施针对性审查，且能逃避现有防御检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型通过训练拒绝回答有害提示来满足伦理标准，但攻击者可能利用这种对齐机制来植入偏见或实施审查，而现有防御措施可能无法有效检测此类攻击。

Method: 提出SAI投毒攻击方法，通过数据投毒（仅需1%投毒数据）使模型在预定义主题上触发拒绝机制，同时保持对其他话题的响应能力。

Result: 实验显示：在ChatDoctor应用中，针对特定种族类别的医疗问题拒绝回答，导致23%的偏见；在简历筛选任务中，对特定大学简历拒绝总结，产生27%的偏见；在其他9个聊天应用中偏见高达38%。

Conclusion: SAI攻击能够有效逃避现有最先进的投毒防御技术，包括LLM状态取证和联邦学习中的鲁棒聚合技术，揭示了LLM对齐机制可能被滥用的安全风险。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are aligned to meet ethical standards and safety
requirements by training them to refuse answering harmful or unsafe prompts. In
this paper, we demonstrate how adversaries can exploit LLMs' alignment to
implant bias, or enforce targeted censorship without degrading the model's
responsiveness to unrelated topics. Specifically, we propose Subversive
Alignment Injection (SAI), a poisoning attack that leverages the alignment
mechanism to trigger refusal on specific topics or queries predefined by the
adversary. Although it is perhaps not surprising that refusal can be induced
through overalignment, we demonstrate how this refusal can be exploited to
inject bias into the model. Surprisingly, SAI evades state-of-the-art poisoning
defenses including LLM state forensics, as well as robust aggregation
techniques that are designed to detect poisoning in FL settings. We demonstrate
the practical dangers of this attack by illustrating its end-to-end impacts on
LLM-powered application pipelines. For chat based applications such as
ChatDoctor, with 1% data poisoning, the system refuses to answer healthcare
questions to targeted racial category leading to high bias ($\Delta DP$ of
23%). We also show that bias can be induced in other NLP tasks: for a resume
selection pipeline aligned to refuse to summarize CVs from a selected
university, high bias in selection ($\Delta DP$ of 27%) results. Even higher
bias ($\Delta DP$~38%) results on 9 other chat based downstream applications.

TL;DR: 这篇论文通过模拟实验比较了合成控制法（SCM）咄双重机器学习（DML）在地理层面营销效果评估中的性能，发现DML方法在复杂场景下更为稳健咄准确。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确评估两边市场地理层面的营销效果常遇挑战：SCM方法虽然效果较好但系统性低估效果大小，而DML方法缺乏与SCM的系统性比较。

Method: 建立了一个开放的、完整文档化的模拟器，模拟大规模地理测试。在5种具体压力测试中评估7种估计器：3种ASC变体咄4种面板DML方法，每个场景重复100次。

Result: ASC模型在复杂场景（非线性或外部冲击）中呈现严重偏差咄近零的覆盖率。相比之下，面板DML方法显著减少了偏差并恢复了标准95%置信区间覆盖率，更加稳健。

Conclusion: 建议采用"先诊断后选择"框架：先识别主要的业务挑战，然后选择最适合该场景的特定DML模型，为地理实验分析提供更稳健咄可靠的方案。

Abstract: Accurately quantifying geo-level marketing lift in two-sided marketplaces is
challenging: the Synthetic Control Method (SCM) often exhibits high power yet
systematically under-estimates effect size, while panel-style Double Machine
Learning (DML) is seldom benchmarked against SCM. We build an open, fully
documented simulator that mimics a typical large-scale geo roll-out: N_unit
regional markets are tracked for T_pre weeks before launch and for a further
T_post-week campaign window, allowing all key parameters to be varied by the
user and probe both families under five stylized stress tests: 1) curved
baseline trends, 2) heterogeneous response lags, 3) treated-biased shocks, 4) a
non-linear outcome link, and 5) a drifting control group trend.
  Seven estimators are evaluated: three standard Augmented SCM (ASC) variants
and four panel-DML flavors (TWFE, CRE/Mundlak, first-difference, and
within-group). Across 100 replications per scenario, ASC models consistently
demonstrate severe bias and near-zero coverage in challenging scenarios
involving nonlinearities or external shocks. By contrast, panel-DML variants
dramatically reduce this bias and restore nominal 95%-CI coverage, proving far
more robust.
  The results indicate that while ASC provides a simple baseline, it is
unreliable in common, complex situations. We therefore propose a
'diagnose-first' framework where practitioners first identify the primary
business challenge (e.g., nonlinear trends, response lags) and then select the
specific DML model best suited for that scenario, providing a more robust and
reliable blueprint for analyzing geo-experiments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CTXSEG的自适应分割方法，用于EEG信号处理，相比固定长度分割能提高癫痫检测性能且需要更少的数据段


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统固定时间切片方法缺乏生物学相关性，因为脑状态不局限于固定间隔，需要更符合生理特性的自适应分割方法

Method: 开发了CTXSEG自适应分割方法，基于EEG数据的统计差异创建变长段，并使用CTXGEN信号生成器生成可控合成数据进行评估

Result: CTXSEG在癫痫检测任务中相比固定长度分割方法提高了性能，且需要更少的数据段

Conclusion: CTXSEG自适应分割方法可轻松应用于现代机器学习方法，是EEG机器学习应用中信号预处理的promising替代方案

Abstract: Objective. Electroencephalography (EEG) data is derived by sampling
continuous neurological time series signals. In order to prepare EEG signals
for machine learning, the signal must be divided into manageable segments. The
current naive approach uses arbitrary fixed time slices, which may have limited
biological relevance because brain states are not confined to fixed intervals.
We investigate whether adaptive segmentation methods are beneficial for machine
learning EEG analysis.
  Approach. We introduce a novel adaptive segmentation method, CTXSEG, that
creates variable-length segments based on statistical differences in the EEG
data and propose ways to use them with modern machine learning approaches that
typically require fixed-length input. We assess CTXSEG using controllable
synthetic data generated by our novel signal generator CTXGEN. While our CTXSEG
method has general utility, we validate it on a real-world use case by applying
it to an EEG seizure detection problem. We compare the performance of CTXSEG
with fixed-length segmentation in the preprocessing step of a typical EEG
machine learning pipeline for seizure detection.
  Main results. We found that using CTXSEG to prepare EEG data improves seizure
detection performance compared to fixed-length approaches when evaluated using
a standardized framework, without modifying the machine learning method, and
requires fewer segments.
  Significance. This work demonstrates that adaptive segmentation with CTXSEG
can be readily applied to modern machine learning approaches, with potential to
improve performance. It is a promising alternative to fixed-length segmentation
for signal preprocessing and should be considered as part of the standard
preprocessing repertoire in EEG machine learning applications.

Motivation: 理解神经网络训练中一阶优化算法在小初始化条件下产生的隐式偏差和正则化效应，特别是梯度流在过参数化矩阵分解问题中表现出的按奇异值大小顺序学习的增量学习现象。

Method: 使用对称矩阵分解问题的闭式解（通过求解Riccati类矩阵微分方程获得），分析梯度流动力学，研究不同目标矩阵分量学习过程中的时间尺度分离现象。

Result: 发现增量学习行为源于学习目标矩阵不同分量时的时间尺度分离，减小初始化尺度会使这种时间尺度分离更加明显，从而能够找到目标矩阵的低秩近似。

Conclusion: 该分析为理解梯度流在矩阵分解问题中的隐式偏差提供了定量框架，并讨论了将分析扩展到非对称矩阵分解问题的可能途径。

Abstract: Many theoretical studies on neural networks attribute their excellent
empirical performance to the implicit bias or regularization induced by
first-order optimization algorithms when training networks under certain
initialization assumptions. One example is the incremental learning phenomenon
in gradient flow (GF) on an overparamerterized matrix factorization problem
with small initialization: GF learns a target matrix by sequentially learning
its singular values in decreasing order of magnitude over time. In this paper,
we develop a quantitative understanding of this incremental learning behavior
for GF on the symmetric matrix factorization problem, using its closed-form
solution obtained by solving a Riccati-like matrix differential equation. We
show that incremental learning emerges from some time-scale separation among
dynamics corresponding to learning different components in the target matrix.
By decreasing the initialization scale, these time-scale separations become
more prominent, allowing one to find low-rank approximations of the target
matrix. Lastly, we discuss the possible avenues for extending this analysis to
asymmetric matrix factorization problems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦检索方法在处理模糊查询时难以检索到高质量相关文档，特别是在跨域场景中，限制了其在下游生成任务中的有效性。

Method: 利用动态信息流(DIF)，通过梯度信号和Shapley值归因来追踪神经元激活路径，识别查询意图和子域边界，然后通过多原型对比学习训练对齐模块实现细粒度语义对齐。

Result: 在五个基准测试中，DFAMS在知识分类准确率上比先进方法提升14.37%，检索召回率提升5.38%，下游QA准确率提升6.45%。

Conclusion: DFAMS框架通过动态信息流实现了跨异构知识源的精确检索，在复杂联邦检索场景中表现出显著优势。

Abstract: Federated Retrieval (FR) routes queries across multiple external knowledge
sources, to mitigate hallucinations of LLMs, when necessary external knowledge
is distributed. However, existing methods struggle to retrieve high-quality and
relevant documents for ambiguous queries, especially in cross-domain scenarios,
which significantly limits their effectiveness in supporting downstream
generation tasks. Inspired by dynamic information flow (DIF), we propose DFAMS,
a novel framework that leverages DIF to identify latent query intents and
construct semantically aligned knowledge partitions for accurate retrieval
across heterogeneous sources. Specifically, DFAMS probes the DIF in LLMs by
leveraging gradient signals from a few annotated queries and employing Shapley
value-based attribution to trace neuron activation paths associated with intent
recognition and subdomain boundary detection. Then, DFAMS leverages DIF to
train an alignment module via multi-prototype contrastive learning, enabling
fine-grained intra-source modeling and inter-source semantic alignment across
knowledge bases. Experimental results across five benchmarks show that DFAMS
outperforms advanced FR methods by up to 14.37% in knowledge classification
accuracy, 5.38% in retrieval recall, and 6.45% in downstream QA accuracy,
demonstrating its effectiveness in complex FR scenarios.

Motivation: 解决传统采样规划器动作采样效率低导致探索缓慢的问题，同时克服学习方法的泛化性差和缺乏安全性保证的局限性

Method: 将扩散策略作为智能采样器集成到RRT等采样规划器中，利用扩散策略建模专家轨迹分布的能力来指导状态空间搜索

Result: 在分布外场景中，DiTree比传统采样规划器快3倍，成功率比扩散策略和采样规划器平均提高30%

Conclusion: DiTree成功结合了学习方法的效率和传统规划器的安全性保证，为复杂动力学系统的运动规划提供了既高效又可证明安全的解决方案

Abstract: Kinodynamic motion planning is concerned with computing collision-free
trajectories while abiding by the robot's dynamic constraints. This critical
problem is often tackled using sampling-based planners (SBPs) that explore the
robot's high-dimensional state space by constructing a search tree via action
propagations. Although SBPs can offer global guarantees on completeness and
solution quality, their performance is often hindered by slow exploration due
to uninformed action sampling. Learning-based approaches can yield
significantly faster runtimes, yet they fail to generalize to
out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios and lack critical guarantees, e.g., safety,
thus limiting their deployment on physical robots. We present Diffusion Tree
(DiTree): a \emph{provably-generalizable} framework leveraging diffusion
policies (DPs) as informed samplers to efficiently guide state-space search
within SBPs. DiTree combines DP's ability to model complex distributions of
expert trajectories, conditioned on local observations, with the completeness
of SBPs to yield \emph{provably-safe} solutions within a few action propagation
iterations for complex dynamical systems. We demonstrate DiTree's power with an
implementation combining the popular RRT planner with a DP action sampler
trained on a \emph{single environment}. In comprehensive evaluations on OOD
scenarios, % DiTree has comparable runtimes to a standalone DP (3x faster than
classical SBPs), while improving the average success rate over DP and SBPs.
DiTree is on average 3x faster than classical SBPs, and outperforms all other
approaches by achieving roughly 30\% higher success rate. Project webpage:

Abstract: Is there a way for a designer to evaluate the performance of a given hood
frame geometry without spending significant time on simulation setup? This
paper seeks to address this challenge by developing a multimodal
machine-learning (MMML) architecture that learns from different modalities of
the same data to predict performance metrics. It also aims to use the MMML
architecture to enhance the efficiency of engineering design processes by
reducing reliance on computationally expensive simulations. The proposed
architecture accelerates design exploration, enabling rapid iteration while
maintaining high-performance standards, especially in the concept design phase.
The study also presents results that show that by combining multiple data
modalities, MMML outperforms traditional single-modality approaches. Two new
frame geometries, not part of the training dataset, are also used for
prediction using the trained MMML model to showcase the ability to generalize
to unseen frame models. The findings underscore MMML's potential in
supplementing traditional simulation-based workflows, particularly in the
conceptual design phase, and highlight its role in bridging the gap between
machine learning and real-world engineering applications. This research paves
the way for the broader adoption of machine learning techniques in engineering
design, with a focus on refining multimodal approaches to optimize structural
development and accelerate the design cycle.

Conclusion: BiListing方法有效解决了多模态信息融合问题，实现了零样本搜索、克服冷启动问题，并能进行跨模态的房源搜索，为Airbnb的业务带来了实质性价值。

Abstract: Airbnb is a leader in offering travel accommodations. Airbnb has historically
relied on structured data to understand, rank, and recommend listings to guests
due to the limited capabilities and associated complexity arising from
extracting meaningful information from text and images. With the rise of
representation learning, leveraging rich information from text and photos has
become easier. A popular approach has been to create embeddings for text
documents and images to enable use cases of computing similarities between
listings or using embeddings as features in an ML model.
  However, an Airbnb listing has diverse unstructured data: multiple images,
various unstructured text documents such as title, description, and reviews,
making this approach challenging. Specifically, it is a non-trivial task to
combine multiple embeddings of different pieces of information to reach a
single representation.
  This paper proposes BiListing, for Bimodal Listing, an approach to align text
and photos of a listing by leveraging large-language models and pretrained
language-image models. The BiListing approach has several favorable
characteristics: capturing unstructured data into a single embedding vector per
listing and modality, enabling zero-shot capability to search inventory
efficiently in user-friendly semantics, overcoming the cold start problem, and
enabling listing-to-listing search along a single modality, or both.
  We conducted offline and online tests to leverage the BiListing embeddings in
the Airbnb search ranking model, and successfully deployed it in production,
achieved 0.425% of NDCB gain, and drove tens of millions in incremental
revenue.

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals serve as a foundational data source for
cardiac digital twins, yet their diagnostic utility is frequently compromised
by noise and artifacts. To address this issue, we propose TF-TransUNet1D, a
novel one-dimensional deep neural network that integrates a U-Net-based
encoder-decoder architecture with a Transformer encoder, guided by a hybrid
time-frequency domain loss. The model is designed to simultaneously capture
local morphological features and long-range temporal dependencies, which are
critical for preserving the diagnostic integrity of ECG signals. To enhance
denoising robustness, we introduce a dual-domain loss function that jointly
optimizes waveform reconstruction in the time domain and spectral fidelity in
the frequency domain. In particular, the frequency-domain component effectively
suppresses high-frequency noise while maintaining the spectral structure of the
signal, enabling recovery of subtle but clinically significant waveform
components. We evaluate TF-TransUNet1D using synthetically corrupted signals
from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database and the Noise Stress Test Database

Abstract: The Transformer architecture has become a cornerstone of modern artificial
intelligence, but its core self-attention mechanism suffers from a complexity
bottleneck that scales quadratically with sequence length, severely limiting
its application in long-sequence tasks. To address this challenge, existing
linear attention methods typically sacrifice model performance by relying on
data-agnostic kernel approximations or restrictive context selection. This
paper returns to the first principles of connectionism, starting from the
topological structure of information flow, to introduce a novel linear
attention architecture-\textbf{TLinFormer}. By reconfiguring neuron connection
patterns, TLinFormer achieves strict linear complexity while computing exact
attention scores and ensuring information flow remains aware of the full
historical context. This design aims to bridge the performance gap prevalent
between existing efficient attention methods and standard attention. Through a
series of experiments, we systematically evaluate the performance of TLinFormer
against a standard Transformer baseline on long-sequence inference tasks. The
results demonstrate that TLinFormer exhibits overwhelming advantages in key
metrics such as \textbf{inference latency}, \textbf{KV cache efficiency},
\textbf{memory footprint}, and \textbf{overall speedup}.

Result: 成功实现了对解码器映射局部变形的定量分析，能够计算学习流形的几何特性（如标量曲率），为流形学习提供了新的几何分析工具。

Conclusion: 非线性保角正则化为自编码器提供了强大的几何正则化框架，不仅改善了表示学习，还提供了定量分析流形几何特性的新方法。

Abstract: One aim of dimensionality reduction is to discover the main factors that
explain the data, and as such is paramount to many applications. When working
with high dimensional data, autoencoders offer a simple yet effective approach
to learn low-dimensional representations. The two components of a general
autoencoder consist first of an encoder that maps the observed data onto a
latent space; and second a decoder that maps the latent space back to the
original observation space, which allows to learn a low-dimensional manifold
representation of the original data. In this article, we introduce a new type
of geometric regularization for decoding maps approximated by deep neural
networks, namely nonlinear conformal regularization. This regularization
procedure permits local variations of the decoder map and comes with a new
scalar field called conformal factor which acts as a quantitative indicator of
the amount of local deformation sustained by the latent space when mapped into
the original data space. We also show that this regularization technique allows
the computation of the scalar curvature of the learned manifold. Implementation
and experiments on the Swiss roll and CelebA datasets are performed to
illustrate how to obtain these quantities from the architecture.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 时间序列预测模型的解释性研究：结合XAI和RDE方法评估不同模型在多领域的性能和可解释性，发现特征工程模型在波动领域更优且更可解释，基础模型在稳定领域更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列预测模型在实际应用中带来重大影响，但其复杂性、性能变化和不透明性形成挑战，需要研究如何评估和理解这些模型的行为。

Method: 结合传统可解释性AI(XAI)方法和评分驱动解释(RDE)，评估4种不同模型架构(ARIMA、Gradient Boosting、Chronos、Llama)在4个异质数据集(金融、能源、交通、汽车销售)上的表现。

Result: 特征工程模型(Gradient Boosting)在波动或稀疏领域(如能源、汽车零件)中持续超过基础模型(Chronos)，且提供更可解释的说明；基础模型仅在稳定或趋势驱动的情境(如金融)中表现优异。

Conclusion: 不同模型在不同领域有着明显的性能差异，特征工程模型在复杂领域更具优势且更可解释，为实际应用中的模型选择提供了重要指导。

Abstract: Time-series forecasting models (TSFM) have evolved from classical statistical
methods to sophisticated foundation models, yet understanding why and when
these models succeed or fail remains challenging. Despite this known
limitation, time series forecasting models are increasingly used to generate
information that informs real-world actions with equally real consequences.
Understanding the complexity, performance variability, and opaque nature of
these models then becomes a valuable endeavor to combat serious concerns about
how users should interact with and rely on these models' outputs. This work
addresses these concerns by combining traditional explainable AI (XAI) methods
with Rating Driven Explanations (RDE) to assess TSFM performance and
interpretability across diverse domains and use cases. We evaluate four
distinct model architectures: ARIMA, Gradient Boosting, Chronos (time-series
specific foundation model), Llama (general-purpose; both fine-tuned and base
models) on four heterogeneous datasets spanning finance, energy,
transportation, and automotive sales domains. In doing so, we demonstrate that
feature-engineered models (e.g., Gradient Boosting) consistently outperform
foundation models (e.g., Chronos) in volatile or sparse domains (e.g., power,
car parts) while providing more interpretable explanations, whereas foundation
models excel only in stable or trend-driven contexts (e.g., finance).

Motivation: 当前状态空间模型参数初始化主要依赖HiPPO框架，但其对角变体的作用未被明确研究。本文旨在从频率角度系统研究对角SSM初始化方案，揭示其学习偏差。

Method: 从频域视角分析对角状态空间模型的初始化机制，提出基于离散傅里叶域的对角初始化方法S4D-DFouT，并研究极点放置的作用。

Result: 提出的S4D-DFouT方法在Long Range Arena基准测试中达到state-of-the-art性能，能够在PathX-256等大型数据集上从头训练。

Conclusion: 通过频域分析对角SSM初始化，提出的S4D-DFouT方法不仅提升了性能，还揭示了极点放置在初始化中的关键作用，为大规模训练提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Current methods for initializing state space models (SSMs) parameters mainly
rely on the \textit{HiPPO framework}, which is based on an online approximation
of orthogonal polynomials. Recently, diagonal alternatives have shown to reach
a similar level of performance while being significantly more efficient due to
the simplification in the kernel computation. However, the \textit{HiPPO
framework} does not explicitly study the role of its diagonal variants. In this
paper, we take a further step to investigate the role of diagonal SSM
initialization schemes from the frequency perspective. Our work seeks to
systematically understand how to parameterize these models and uncover the
learning biases inherent in such diagonal state-space models. Based on our
observations, we propose a diagonal initialization on the discrete Fourier
domain \textit{S4D-DFouT}. The insights in the role of pole placing in the
initialization enable us to further scale them and achieve state-of-the-art
results on the Long Range Arena benchmark, allowing us to train from scratch on
very large datasets as PathX-256.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EAGLE-PC是一个新型的机器遗忘框架，通过嵌入空间相似度测量和ICL生成的代理约束，解决了现有遗忘方法中遗忘边界不明确的问题，在保持模型效用的同时实现更精准的数据遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型训练数据可能包含隐私或版权内容，现有遗忘方法缺乏明确的遗忘边界，导致部分样本遗忘不足（残留泄露风险）或过度遗忘（牺牲模型效用）。

Method: 提出EAGLE-PC框架，包含两个核心组件：1）纠缠感知引导的损失重加权，通过测量样本与保留样本在嵌入空间的相似度来确定遗忘力度；2）利用ICL生成测试数据的代理约束，软正则化遗忘过程以防止过度遗忘。

Result: 在TOFU和MUSE基准测试中，EAGLE-PC在多个LLM上 consistently 改善了遗忘-效用权衡，结合NPO+GD优化器时接近完全重新训练的性能。

Conclusion: EAGLE-PC提供了一个可扩展且鲁棒的遗忘解决方案，可作为即插即用的增强模块与现有基于梯度的目标兼容，有效解决了机器遗忘中的边界模糊问题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are trained on massive datasets that may include
private or copyrighted content. Due to growing privacy and ownership concerns,
data owners may request the removal of their data from trained models. Machine
unlearning provides a practical solution by removing the influence of specific
data without full retraining. However, most existing methods lack a sound
forgetting boundary, causing some samples to be under-forgotten, leaving
residual leakage risks, while others remain over-forgotten at the expense of
degraded utility.
  In this work, we propose EAGLE-PC (Entanglement-Awareness Guided Loss
Reweighting with Proxy Constraint), a novel unlearning framework that addresses
these limitations through two key components. First, entanglement-awareness
guided loss reweighting determines the forgetting effort of each sample by
measuring its similarity to retain samples in the embedding space, enabling
more targeted and effective unlearning. Second, a proxy constraint leveraging
ICL (In-Context Learning) generated test data softly regularizes the forgetting
process, effectively mitigating over-forgetting. EAGLE-PC is compatible with
existing gradient-based objectives and serves as a plug-and-play enhancement.
We evaluate EAGLE-PC on the TOFU and MUSE benchmarks, showing consistent
improvements in the forgetting-utility trade-off across multiple LLMs. Combined
with the NPO+GD optimizer, it approaches full retraining performance, offering
a scalable and robust unlearning solution.

Abstract: Generative AI offers transformative potential for high-stakes domains such as
healthcare and finance, yet privacy and regulatory barriers hinder the use of
real-world data. To address this, differentially private synthetic data
generation has emerged as a promising alternative. In this work, we introduce a
unified benchmark to systematically evaluate the utility and fidelity of text
datasets generated under formal Differential Privacy (DP) guarantees. Our
benchmark addresses key challenges in domain-specific benchmarking, including
choice of representative data and realistic privacy budgets, accounting for
pre-training and a variety of evaluation metrics. We assess state-of-the-art
privacy-preserving generation methods across five domain-specific datasets,
revealing significant utility and fidelity degradation compared to real data,
especially under strict privacy constraints. These findings underscore the
limitations of current approaches, outline the need for advanced
privacy-preserving data sharing methods and set a precedent regarding their
evaluation in realistic scenarios.

Result: 在真实EHR数据集上的实验表明，SHGT在诊断预测任务上超越了现有最先进模型

Conclusion: SHGT框架通过超图和Transformer的结合，有效解决了EHR中高阶依赖关系建模的挑战，提升了诊断预测性能

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR) systematically organize patient health data
through standardized medical codes, serving as a comprehensive and invaluable
source for predictive modeling. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated
effectiveness in modeling interactions between medical codes within EHR.
However, existing GNN-based methods are inadequate due to: a) their reliance on
pairwise relations fails to capture the inherent higher-order dependencies in
clinical data, and b) the localized message-passing scheme limits
representation power. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel
Structure-aware HyperGraph Transformer (SHGT) framework following three-fold
ideas: a) employing a hypergraph structural encoder to capture higher-order
interactions among medical codes, b) integrating the Transformer architecture
to reason over the entire hypergraph, and c) designing a tailored loss function
incorporating hypergraph reconstruction to preserve the hypergraph's original
structure. Experiments on real-world EHR datasets demonstrate that the proposed
SHGT outperforms existing state-of-the-art models on diagnosis prediction.

Conclusion: MedGR²为高风险领域的数据高效学习提供了新范式，将问题从数据稀缺转变为数据生成，释放了强化学习在构建真正可泛化医疗AI方面的全部潜力。

Abstract: The application of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in medicine is critically
hampered by the scarcity of high-quality, expert-annotated data. Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) on existing datasets often leads to poor generalization on
unseen modalities and tasks, while Reinforcement Learning (RL), a promising
alternative, is stymied by the lack of reliable reward signals in this
data-scarce domain. To break this impasse, we introduce Generative Reward
Learning for Medical Reasoning (MedGR$^2$), a novel framework that creates a
self-improving virtuous cycle. MedGR$^2$ co-develops a data generator and a
reward model, enabling the automated, continuous creation of high-quality,
multi-modal medical data that serves as both a superior training source for SFT
and RL. Our experiments demonstrate that SFT with MedGR$^2$-produced data
already surpasses baselines trained on large-scale, human-curated datasets.
Crucially, when leveraging this data for RL via Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO), our model achieves state-of-the-art cross-modality and
cross-task generalization, significantly outperforming specialized RL-based
methods. Furthermore, our compact model, empowered by MedGR$^2$, achieves
performance competitive with foundation models possessing over 10 times more
parameters. MedGR$^2$ presents a new paradigm for data-efficient learning in
high-stakes domains, transforming the problem from data scarcity to data
generation and unlocking the full potential of RL for building truly
generalizable medical AI.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MERIT是一种新颖的优化器，通过max-norm计算信任比来更有效地约束注意力层的最大注意力对数，解决了大批次训练中的优化和泛化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有优化器如AdamW和LAMB在大批次训练语言模型时存在性能下降问题，主要原因是注意力层中最大注意力对数的急剧增加导致信息瓶颈，以及LAMB中基于l2范数的信任比无法有效影响查询/键权重的最大值。

Method: 提出MERIT优化器，利用max-norm计算信任比来更有效地约束最大注意力对数，并构建元素级信任比通过关注局部权重结构来提供更稳健的更新缩放。

Result: 在各种规模的GPT-2模型上进行的大批次训练实验表明MERIT具有优越性能。在GPT-2 Medium训练中，MERIT实现了6k批次大小而无性能下降，相比标准批次大小（480）使用48B训练词元。

Conclusion: 这项工作强调了在大批次训练中考虑最大注意力对数和更细粒度信任比的重要性，成功提高了训练稳定性，为更大批次使用铺平了道路，使大型语言模型的开发和迭代更快。

Abstract: Large-batch training has become a cornerstone in accelerating the training of
deep neural networks, yet it poses challenges in optimization and
generalization. Existing optimizers like AdamW present performance degradation
during language models' large-batch training, due to the information bottleneck
in attention layers caused by the sharp increase of max attention logit. While
the LAMB optimizer partially addresses this issue, some attention layers still
face this issue. The reason is that $l_2$-norm-based trust ratios in LAMB are
less effective in directly influencing the max value of query/key weights.
Furthermore, the weight-wise trust ratio in LAMB is error-prone as it overlooks
relationships of weight values within rows or columns. Building on these
observations, we propose a novel optimizer, MERIT, which leverages the max-norm
to calculate the trust ratio to constrain the max attention logit more
effectively. Moreover, we further construct element-wise trust ratios to
provide more robust update scaling by focusing on local weight structures.
Extensive experiments of large-batch training across various sizes of GPT-2
models demonstrate the superior performance of MERIT. Notably, during the
training of GPT-2 Medium, MERIT enables a 6k batch size without any performance
degradation compared to the standard batch size (480) with 48B training tokens.
This work highlights the importance of considering the max attention logit and
finer-granularity trust ratio in large-batch training. It successfully improves
the training stability and paves the way for larger batch usage, enabling
faster development and iteration of large language models. Code is available at

Conclusion: 该方法为高斯过程随机超参数学习提供了更可靠的精确推断方案，特别适用于计算资源受限的场景

Abstract: Current methods for stochastic hyperparameter learning in Gaussian Processes
(GPs) rely on approximations, such as computing biased stochastic gradients or
using inducing points in stochastic variational inference. However, when using
such methods we are not guaranteed to converge to a stationary point of the
true marginal likelihood. In this work, we propose algorithms for exact
stochastic inference of GPs with kernels that induce a Reproducing Kernel
Hilbert Space (RKHS) of moderate finite dimension. Our approach can also be
extended to infinite dimensional RKHSs at the cost of forgoing exactness. Both
for finite and infinite dimensional RKHSs, our method achieves better
experimental results than existing methods when memory resources limit the
feasible batch size and the possible number of inducing points.

Abstract: Over-squashing is a challenge in training graph neural networks for tasks
involving long-range dependencies. In such tasks, a GNN's receptive field
should be large enough to enable communication between distant nodes. However,
gathering information from a wide range of neighborhoods and squashing its
content into fixed-size node representations makes message-passing vulnerable
to bottlenecks. Graph rewiring and adding virtual nodes are commonly studied
remedies that create additional pathways around bottlenecks to mitigate
over-squashing. However, these techniques alter the input graph's global
topology and disrupt the domain knowledge encoded in the original graph
structure, both of which could be essential to specific tasks and domains. This
study presents Local Virtual Nodes (LVN) with trainable embeddings to alleviate
the effects of over-squashing without significantly corrupting the global
structure of the input graph. The position of the LVNs is determined by the
node centrality, which indicates the existence of potential bottlenecks. Thus,
the proposed approach aims to improve the connectivity in the regions with
likely bottlenecks. Furthermore, trainable LVN embeddings shared across
selected central regions facilitate communication between distant nodes without
adding more layers. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate
that LVNs can enhance structural connectivity and significantly improve
performance on graph and node classification tasks. The code can be found at

Abstract: Assessing whether a sample survey credibly represents the population is a
critical question for ensuring the validity of downstream research. Generally,
this problem reduces to estimating the distance between two high-dimensional
distributions, which typically requires a number of samples that grows
exponentially with the dimension. However, depending on the model used for data
analysis, the conclusions drawn from the data may remain consistent across
different underlying distributions. In this context, we propose a task-based
approach to assess the credibility of sampled surveys. Specifically, we
introduce a model-specific distance metric to quantify this notion of
credibility. We also design an algorithm to verify the credibility of survey
data in the context of regression models. Notably, the sample complexity of our
algorithm is independent of the data dimension. This efficiency stems from the
fact that the algorithm focuses on verifying the credibility of the survey data
rather than reconstructing the underlying regression model. Furthermore, we
show that if one attempts to verify credibility by reconstructing the
regression model, the sample complexity scales linearly with the dimensionality
of the data. We prove the theoretical correctness of our algorithm and
numerically demonstrate our algorithm's performance.

invertible matrices with joint learning of a prediction model through
backpropagation. We illustrate the proposed algorithm on synthetic and real

Conclusion: MAE通过可扩展的自监督学习在超声信号分析中展现出巨大潜力，为1D信号处理提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: We investigated the adaptation and performance of Masked Autoencoders (MAEs)
with Vision Transformer (ViT) architectures for self-supervised representation
learning on one-dimensional (1D) ultrasound signals. Although MAEs have
demonstrated significant success in computer vision and other domains, their
use for 1D signal analysis, especially for raw ultrasound data, remains largely
unexplored. Ultrasound signals are vital in industrial applications such as
non-destructive testing (NDT) and structural health monitoring (SHM), where
labeled data are often scarce and signal processing is highly task-specific. We
propose an approach that leverages MAE to pre-train on unlabeled synthetic
ultrasound signals, enabling the model to learn robust representations that
enhance performance in downstream tasks, such as time-of-flight (ToF)
classification. This study systematically investigated the impact of model
size, patch size, and masking ratio on pre-training efficiency and downstream
accuracy. Our results show that pre-trained models significantly outperform
models trained from scratch and strong convolutional neural network (CNN)
baselines optimized for the downstream task. Additionally, pre-training on
synthetic data demonstrates superior transferability to real-world measured
signals compared with training solely on limited real datasets. This study
underscores the potential of MAEs for advancing ultrasound signal analysis
through scalable, self-supervised learning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable multimodal information
processing and reasoning ability. When equipped with tools through function
calling and enhanced with retrieval-augmented techniques, compound LLM-based
systems can access closed data sources and answer questions about them.
However, they still struggle to process and reason over large-scale
graph-structure data. We introduce the GDS (Graph Data Science) agent in this
technical report. The GDS agent introduces a comprehensive set of graph
algorithms as tools, together with preprocessing (retrieval) and postprocessing
of algorithm results, in a model context protocol (MCP) server. The server can
be used with any modern LLM out-of-the-box. GDS agent allows users to ask any
question that implicitly and intrinsically requires graph algorithmic reasoning
about their data, and quickly obtain accurate and grounded answers. We also
introduce a new benchmark that evaluates intermediate tool calls as well as
final responses. The results indicate that GDS agent is able to solve a wide
spectrum of graph tasks. We also provide detailed case studies for more
open-ended tasks and study scenarios where the agent struggles. Finally, we
discuss the remaining challenges and the future roadmap.

Result: 理论分析显示TV-HSGT能在不假设梯度有界的情况下改善动态遗憾界，逻辑回归实验验证了其在动态资源受限环境中的有效性

Conclusion: TV-HSGT算法为时变有向网络中的分布式在线优化提供了有效的解决方案，具有理论保证和实际应用价值

Abstract: With the increasing scale and dynamics of data, distributed online
optimization has become essential for real-time decision-making in various
applications. However, existing algorithms often rely on bounded gradient
assumptions and overlook the impact of stochastic gradients, especially in
time-varying directed networks. This study proposes a novel Time-Varying Hybrid
Stochastic Gradient Tracking algorithm named TV-HSGT, based on hybrid
stochastic gradient tracking and variance reduction mechanisms. Specifically,
TV-HSGT integrates row-stochastic and column-stochastic communication schemes
over time-varying digraphs, eliminating the need for Perron vector estimation
or out-degree information. By combining current and recursive stochastic
gradients, it effectively reduces gradient variance while accurately tracking
global descent directions. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that TV-HSGT can
achieve improved bounds on dynamic regret without assuming gradient
boundedness. Experimental results on logistic regression tasks confirm the
effectiveness of TV-HSGT in dynamic and resource-constrained environments.

Result: VarDiU在一步扩散蒸馏中实现了更高的生成质量，训练过程更高效稳定。

Conclusion: VarDiU通过无偏梯度估计解决了扩散蒸馏中的梯度偏差问题，显著提升了一步生成器的性能和训练效率。

Abstract: Recently, diffusion distillation methods have compressed thousand-step
teacher diffusion models into one-step student generators while preserving
sample quality. Most existing approaches train the student model using a
diffusive divergence whose gradient is approximated via the student's score
function, learned through denoising score matching (DSM). Since DSM training is
imperfect, the resulting gradient estimate is inevitably biased, leading to
sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose VarDiU (pronounced
/va:rdju:/), a Variational Diffusive Upper Bound that admits an unbiased
gradient estimator and can be directly applied to diffusion distillation. Using
this objective, we compare our method with Diff-Instruct and demonstrate that
it achieves higher generation quality and enables a more efficient and stable
training procedure for one-step diffusion distillation.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel framework to enhance the efficiency and
accuracy of neural operators through self-composition, offering both
theoretical guarantees and practical benefits. Inspired by iterative methods in
solving numerical partial differential equations (PDEs), we design a specific
neural operator by repeatedly applying a single neural operator block, we
progressively deepen the model without explicitly adding new blocks, improving
the model's capacity. To train these models efficiently, we introduce an
adaptive train-and-unroll approach, where the depth of the neural operator is
gradually increased during training. This approach reveals an accuracy scaling
law with model depth and offers significant computational savings through our
adaptive training strategy. Our architecture achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance on standard benchmarks. We further demonstrate its efficacy on a
challenging high-frequency ultrasound computed tomography (USCT) problem, where
a multigrid-inspired backbone enables superior performance in resolving complex
wave phenomena. The proposed framework provides a computationally tractable,
accurate, and scalable solution for large-scale data-driven scientific machine
learning applications.

Abstract: This work investigates whether time series of natural phenomena can be
understood as being generated by sequences of latent states which are ordered
in systematic and regular ways. We focus on clinical time series and ask
whether clinical measurements can be interpreted as being generated by
meaningful physiological states whose succession follows systematic principles.
Uncovering the underlying compositional structure will allow us to create
synthetic data to alleviate the notorious problem of sparse and low-resource
data settings in clinical time series forecasting, and deepen our understanding
of clinical data. We start by conceptualizing compositionality for time series
as a property of the data generation process, and then study data-driven
procedures that can reconstruct the elementary states and composition rules of
this process. We evaluate the success of this methods using two empirical tests
originating from a domain adaptation perspective. Both tests infer the
similarity of the original time series distribution and the synthetic time
series distribution from the similarity of expected risk of time series
forecasting models trained and tested on original and synthesized data in
specific ways. Our experimental results show that the test set performance
achieved by training on compositionally synthesized data is comparable to
training on original clinical time series data, and that evaluation of models
on compositionally synthesized test data shows similar results to evaluating on
original test data, outperforming randomization-based data augmentation. An
additional downstream evaluation of the prediction task of sequential organ
failure assessment (SOFA) scores shows significant performance gains when model
training is entirely based on compositionally synthesized data compared to
training on original data.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型能力增强，有害微调风险增加。现有研究主要关注监督微调(SFT)的滥用，但研究发现强化学习(RL)能更有效地破坏安全对齐并促进有害任务协助。

Method: 提出TokenBuncher防御方法：1）使用熵作为奖励的RL来约束不确定性；2）Token Noiser机制防止专家领域有害能力升级。通过抑制模型响应不确定性来阻断RL依赖的奖励信号基础。

Result: 跨多个模型和RL算法的广泛实验表明，TokenBuncher能有效缓解有害RL微调，同时保持良性任务效用和微调能力。证明RL有害微调比SFT具有更大系统性风险。

Conclusion: RL基有害微调构成比SFT更大的威胁，TokenBuncher提供了有效且通用的防御解决方案，为应对新兴RL滥用风险提供了重要保护机制。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to grow in capability, so do the
risks of harmful misuse through fine-tuning. While most prior studies assume
that attackers rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for such misuse, we
systematically demonstrate that reinforcement learning (RL) enables adversaries
to more effectively break safety alignment and facilitate advanced harmful task
assistance, under matched computational budgets. To counter this emerging
threat, we propose TokenBuncher, the first effective defense specifically
targeting RL-based harmful fine-tuning. TokenBuncher suppresses the foundation
on which RL relies: model response uncertainty. By constraining uncertainty,
RL-based fine-tuning can no longer exploit distinct reward signals to drive the
model toward harmful behaviors. We realize this defense through
entropy-as-reward RL and a Token Noiser mechanism designed to prevent the
escalation of expert-domain harmful capabilities. Extensive experiments across
multiple models and RL algorithms show that TokenBuncher robustly mitigates
harmful RL fine-tuning while preserving benign task utility and finetunability.
Our results highlight that RL-based harmful fine-tuning poses a greater
systemic risk than SFT, and that TokenBuncher provides an effective and general
defense.

Abstract: While electroencephalography (EEG) signal analysis using deep learning has
shown great promise, existing approaches still face significant challenges in
learning generalizable representations that perform well across diverse tasks,
particularly when training data is limited. Current EEG representation learning
methods including EEGPT and LaBraM typically rely on simple masked
reconstruction objective, which may not fully capture the rich semantic
information and complex patterns inherent in EEG signals. In this paper, we
propose EEGDM, a novel self-supervised EEG representation learning method based
on the latent diffusion model, which leverages EEG signal generation as a
self-supervised objective, turning the diffusion model into a strong
representation learner capable of capturing EEG semantics. EEGDM incorporates
an EEG encoder that distills EEG signals and their channel augmentations into a
compact representation, acting as conditional information to guide the
diffusion model for generating EEG signals. This design endows EEGDM with a
compact latent space, which not only offers ample control over the generative
process but also can be leveraged for downstream tasks. Experimental results
show that EEGDM (1) can reconstruct high-quality EEG signals, (2) effectively
learns robust representations, and (3) achieves competitive performance with
modest pre-training data size across diverse downstream tasks, underscoring its
generalizability and practical utility.

Abstract: Tool-augmented language models, equipped with retrieval, memory, or external
APIs, are reshaping AI, yet their theoretical advantages remain underexplored.
In this paper, we address this question by demonstrating the benefits of
in-tool learning (external retrieval) over in-weight learning (memorization)
for factual recall. We show that the number of facts a model can memorize
solely in its weights is fundamentally limited by its parameter count. In
contrast, we prove that tool-use enables unbounded factual recall via a simple
and efficient circuit construction. These results are validated in controlled
experiments, where tool-using models consistently outperform memorizing ones.
We further show that for pretrained large language models, teaching tool-use
and general rules is more effective than finetuning facts into memory. Our work
provides both a theoretical and empirical foundation, establishing why
tool-augmented workflows are not just practical, but provably more scalable.

conditioned on impermissible classes by ultimately halting its denoising
process. Also, our method controls the balance between forgetting and retention
by selectively focusing on the early diffusion steps, where class-specific

Conclusion: cMALC-D框架通过LLM引导的课程学习和多样性上下文混合，有效解决了多智能体强化学习在复杂不确定环境中的泛化问题。

Abstract: Many multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms are trained in
fixed simulation environments, making them brittle when deployed in real-world
scenarios with more complex and uncertain conditions. Contextual MARL (cMARL)
addresses this by parameterizing environments with context variables and
training a context-agnostic policy that performs well across all environment
configurations. Existing cMARL methods attempt to use curriculum learning to
help train and evaluate context-agnostic policies, but they often rely on
unreliable proxy signals, such as value estimates or generalized advantage
estimates that are noisy and unstable in multi-agent settings due to
inter-agent dynamics and partial observability. To address these issues, we
propose Contextual Multi-Agent LLM-Guided Curriculum Learning with
Diversity-Based Context Blending (cMALC-D), a framework that uses Large
Language Models (LLMs) to generate semantically meaningful curricula and
provide a more robust evaluation signal. To prevent mode collapse and encourage
exploration, we introduce a novel diversity-based context blending mechanism
that creates new training scenarios by combining features from prior contexts.
Experiments in traffic signal control domains demonstrate that cMALC-D
significantly improves both generalization and sample efficiency compared to
existing curriculum learning baselines. We provide code at

Abstract: Feature transformation plays a critical role in enhancing machine learning
model performance by optimizing data representations. Recent state-of-the-art
approaches address this task as a continuous embedding optimization problem,
converting discrete search into a learnable process. Although effective, these
methods often rely on sequential encoder-decoder structures that cause high
computational costs and parameter requirements, limiting scalability and
efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework that
accomplishes automated feature transformation through four steps:
transformation records collection, embedding space construction with a revised
Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) model, gradient-ascent search, and
autoregressive reconstruction. In our approach, the revised GPT model serves
two primary functions: (a) feature transformation sequence reconstruction and
(b) model performance estimation and enhancement for downstream tasks by
constructing the embedding space. Such a multi-objective optimization framework
reduces parameter size and accelerates transformation processes. Experimental
results on benchmark datasets show that the proposed framework matches or
exceeds baseline performance, with significant gains in computational
efficiency. This work highlights the potential of transformer-based
architectures for scalable, high-performance automated feature transformation.

Abstract: Financial fraud detection is essential to safeguard billions of dollars, yet
the intertwined entities and fast-changing transaction behaviors in modern
financial systems routinely defeat conventional machine learning models. Recent
graph-based detectors make headway by representing transactions as networks,
but they still overlook two fraud hallmarks rooted in time: (1) temporal
motifs--recurring, telltale subgraphs that reveal suspicious money flows as
they unfold--and (2) account-specific intervals of anomalous activity, when
fraud surfaces only in short bursts unique to each entity. To exploit both
signals, we introduce ATM-GAD, an adaptive graph neural network that leverages
temporal motifs for financial anomaly detection. A Temporal Motif Extractor
condenses each account's transaction history into the most informative motifs,
preserving both topology and temporal patterns. These motifs are then analyzed
by dual-attention blocks: IntraA reasons over interactions within a single
motif, while InterA aggregates evidence across motifs to expose multi-step
fraud schemes. In parallel, a differentiable Adaptive Time-Window Learner
tailors the observation window for every node, allowing the model to focus
precisely on the most revealing time slices. Experiments on four real-world
datasets show that ATM-GAD consistently outperforms seven strong
anomaly-detection baselines, uncovering fraud patterns missed by earlier
methods.

Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) is ubiquitous thanks to the rapid development of
wireless technologies. However, the broadcast nature of wireless transmissions
results in great vulnerability to device authentication. Physical layer
authentication emerges as a promising approach by exploiting the unique channel
characteristics. However, a practical scheme applicable to dynamic channel
variations is still missing. In this paper, we proposed a deep learning-based
physical layer channel state information (CSI) authentication for mobile
scenarios and carried out comprehensive simulation and experimental evaluation
using IEEE 802.11n. Specifically, a synthetic training dataset was generated
based on the WLAN TGn channel model and the autocorrelation and the distance
correlation of the channel, which can significantly reduce the overhead of
manually collecting experimental datasets. A convolutional neural network
(CNN)-based Siamese network was exploited to learn the temporal and spatial
correlation between the CSI pair and output a score to measure their
similarity. We adopted a synergistic methodology involving both simulation and
experimental evaluation. The experimental testbed consisted of WiFi IoT
development kits and a few typical scenarios were specifically considered. Both
simulation and experimental evaluation demonstrated excellent generalization
performance of our proposed deep learning-based approach and excellent
authentication performance. Demonstrated by our practical measurement results,
our proposed scheme improved the area under the curve (AUC) by 0.03 compared to
the fully connected network-based (FCN-based) Siamese model and by 0.06
compared to the correlation-based benchmark algorithm.

TL;DR: LeMat-Traj是一个标准化的量子力学轨迹数据集，包含1.2亿个原子构型，解决了MLIP训练中数据分散和格式不一致的问题，显著降低了训练准确机器学习间势的障碍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器学习间势(MLIPs)开发中量子力学轨迹数据集分散、格式不一致、难以整合的问题，这些DFT数据集生成成本高但难以组合使用。

Method: 开发LeMat-Traj标准化数据集，整合Materials Project、Alexandria和OQMD等大型存储库的1.2亿个原子构型，统一数据表示，协调结果并筛选高质量构型，涵盖PBE、PBESol、SCAN、r2SCAN等DFT泛函。

Conclusion: LeMat-Traj为标准化的材料数据集提供了解决方案，显著降低了训练可迁移和准确MLIPs的障碍，配套的开源工具支持社区持续扩展数据源，推动大规模材料数据集的发展。

Abstract: The development of accurate machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs)
is limited by the fragmented availability and inconsistent formatting of
quantum mechanical trajectory datasets derived from Density Functional Theory
(DFT). These datasets are expensive to generate yet difficult to combine due to
variations in format, metadata, and accessibility. To address this, we
introduce LeMat-Traj, a curated dataset comprising over 120 million atomic
configurations aggregated from large-scale repositories, including the
Materials Project, Alexandria, and OQMD. LeMat-Traj standardizes data
representation, harmonizes results and filters for high-quality configurations
across widely used DFT functionals (PBE, PBESol, SCAN, r2SCAN). It
significantly lowers the barrier for training transferrable and accurate MLIPs.
LeMat-Traj spans both relaxed low-energy states and high-energy, high-force
structures, complementing molecular dynamics and active learning datasets. By
fine-tuning models pre-trained on high-force data with LeMat-Traj, we achieve a
significant reduction in force prediction errors on relaxation tasks. We also
present LeMaterial-Fetcher, a modular and extensible open-source library
developed for this work, designed to provide a reproducible framework for the
community to easily incorporate new data sources and ensure the continued
evolution of large-scale materials datasets. LeMat-Traj and LeMaterial-Fetcher
are publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/LeMaterial/LeMat-Traj
and https://github.com/LeMaterial/lematerial-fetcher.

Abstract: While foundation models have revolutionized such fields as natural language
processing and computer vision, their application and potential within graph
machine learning remain largely unexplored. One of the key challenges in
designing graph foundation models (GFMs) is handling diverse node features that
can vary across different graph datasets. Although many works on GFMs have been
focused exclusively on text-attributed graphs, the problem of handling
arbitrary features of other types in GFMs has not been fully addressed.
However, this problem is not unique to the graph domain, as it also arises in
the field of machine learning for tabular data. In this work, motivated by the
recent success of tabular foundation models like TabPFNv2, we propose G2T-FM, a
simple graph foundation model that employs TabPFNv2 as a backbone.
Specifically, G2T-FM augments the original node features with neighborhood
feature aggregation, adds structural embeddings, and then applies TabPFNv2 to
the constructed node representations. Even in a fully in-context regime, our
model achieves strong results, significantly outperforming publicly available
GFMs and performing on par with well-tuned GNNs trained from scratch. Moreover,
after finetuning, G2T-FM surpasses well-tuned GNN baselines, highlighting the
potential of the proposed approach. More broadly, our paper reveals a
previously overlooked direction of utilizing tabular foundation models for
graph machine learning tasks.

Abstract: We study a sequential resource allocation problem where a decision maker
selects subsets of agents at each period to maximize overall outcomes without
prior knowledge of individual-level effects. Our framework applies to settings
such as community health interventions, targeted digital advertising, and
workforce retention programs, where intervention effects evolve dynamically.
Agents may exhibit habituation (diminished response from frequent selection) or
recovery (enhanced response from infrequent selection). The technical challenge
centers on nonstationary reward distributions that lead to changing
intervention effects over time. The problem requires balancing two key
competing objectives: heterogeneous individual rewards and the
exploration-exploitation tradeoff in terms of learning for improved future
decisions as opposed to maximizing immediate outcomes. Our contribution
introduces the first framework incorporating this form of nonstationary rewards
in the combinatorial multi-armed bandit literature. We develop algorithms with
theoretical guarantees on dynamic regret and demonstrate practical efficacy
through a diabetes intervention case study. Our personalized community
intervention algorithm achieved up to three times as much improvement in
program enrollment compared to baseline approaches, validating the framework's
potential for real-world applications. This work bridges theoretical advances
in adaptive learning with practical challenges in population-level behavioral
change interventions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: InSQuAD通过子模互信息(SMI)提升上下文学习性能，使用质量与多样性统一选择策略和组合训练范式，在9个基准数据集上显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有检索模型只关注查询相关性而忽视多样性问题，这对于上下文学习至关重要。

Method: 1) 将ICL建模为目标选择问题，基于SMI的统一选择策略；2) 引入组合训练范式，通过似然损失学习SMI参数；3) 使用合成释义增强多跳问答数据集。

Result: 在九个基准数据集上显示出显著改进，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: InSQuAD通过同时确保质量和多样性，有效提升了上下文学习的性能表现。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce InSQuAD, designed to enhance the performance of
In-Context Learning (ICL) models through Submodular Mutual Information} (SMI)
enforcing Quality and Diversity among in-context exemplars. InSQuAD achieves
this through two principal strategies: First, we model the ICL task as a
targeted selection problem and introduce a unified selection strategy based on
SMIs which mines relevant yet diverse in-context examples encapsulating the
notions of quality and diversity. Secondly, we address a common pitfall in
existing retrieval models which model query relevance, often overlooking
diversity, critical for ICL. InSQuAD introduces a combinatorial training
paradigm which learns the parameters of an SMI function to enforce both quality
and diversity in the retrieval model through a novel likelihood-based loss. To
further aid the learning process we augment an existing multi-hop question
answering dataset with synthetically generated paraphrases. Adopting the
retrieval model trained using this strategy alongside the novel targeted
selection formulation for ICL on nine benchmark datasets shows significant
improvements validating the efficacy of our approach.

Abstract: Denoising-based generative models, particularly diffusion and flow matching
algorithms, have achieved remarkable success. However, aligning their output
distributions with complex downstream objectives, such as human preferences,
compositional accuracy, or data compressibility, remains challenging. While
reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning methods, inspired by advances in RL
from human feedback (RLHF) for large language models, have been adapted to
these generative frameworks, current RL approaches are suboptimal for diffusion
models and offer limited flexibility in controlling alignment strength after
fine-tuning. In this work, we reinterpret RL fine-tuning for diffusion models
through the lens of stochastic differential equations and implicit reward
conditioning. We introduce Reinforcement Learning Guidance (RLG), an
inference-time method that adapts Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) by combining
the outputs of the base and RL fine-tuned models via a geometric average. Our
theoretical analysis shows that RLG's guidance scale is mathematically
equivalent to adjusting the KL-regularization coefficient in standard RL
objectives, enabling dynamic control over the alignment-quality trade-off
without further training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RLG
consistently improves the performance of RL fine-tuned models across various
architectures, RL algorithms, and downstream tasks, including human
preferences, compositional control, compressibility, and text rendering.
Furthermore, RLG supports both interpolation and extrapolation, thereby
offering unprecedented flexibility in controlling generative alignment. Our
approach provides a practical and theoretically sound solution for enhancing
and controlling diffusion model alignment at inference. The source code for RLG
is publicly available at the Github:

TL;DR: 该论文首次为子采样自然梯度下降(SNGD)及其加速变体SPRING提供了理论收敛性分析，证明了在最小二乘问题中SNGD等价于正则化Kaczmarz方法，SPRING等价于加速正则化Kaczmarz方法，并获得了快速收敛速率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SNGD在科学机器学习中表现出色但缺乏理论解释，需要填补这一理论空白，理解子采样与曲率感知优化策略之间的相互作用。

Method: 通过将SNGD和SPRING与正则化Kaczmarz方法建立等价关系，利用随机线性代数工具分析收敛性，特别针对线性模型和强凸二次损失函数的理想化参数优化问题。

Result: 获得了SNGD的快速收敛速率、SPRING的首个收敛保证，并证明SPRING可以加速SNGD，为SNGD在最小二乘之外的有效性提供了首个解释。

Conclusion: 随机线性代数工具能够揭示子采样与曲率感知优化策略之间的相互作用，为SNGD和SPRING的理论理解提供了重要基础。

Abstract: Subsampled natural gradient descent (SNGD) has shown impressive results for
parametric optimization tasks in scientific machine learning, such as neural
network wavefunctions and physics-informed neural networks, but it has lacked a
theoretical explanation. We address this gap by analyzing the convergence of
SNGD and its accelerated variant, SPRING, for idealized parametric optimization
problems where the model is linear and the loss function is strongly convex and
quadratic. In the special case of a least-squares loss, namely the standard
linear least-squares problem, we prove that SNGD is equivalent to a regularized
Kaczmarz method while SPRING is equivalent to an accelerated regularized
Kaczmarz method. As a result, by leveraging existing analyses we obtain under
mild conditions (i) the first fast convergence rate for SNGD, (ii) the first
convergence guarantee for SPRING in any setting, and (iii) the first proof that
SPRING can accelerate SNGD. In the case of a general strongly convex quadratic
loss, we extend the analysis of the regularized Kaczmarz method to obtain a
fast convergence rate for SNGD under stronger conditions, providing the first
explanation for the effectiveness of SNGD outside of the least-squares setting.
Overall, our results illustrate how tools from randomized linear algebra can
shed new light on the interplay between subsampling and curvature-aware
optimization strategies.

Conclusion: LoTUS提供了一种实用且有效的机器学习遗忘解决方案，无需重新训练就能从预训练模型中消除训练样本的影响，适用于现实世界的大规模应用场景。

Abstract: We present LoTUS, a novel Machine Unlearning (MU) method that eliminates the
influence of training samples from pre-trained models, avoiding retraining from
scratch. LoTUS smooths the prediction probabilities of the model up to an
information-theoretic bound, mitigating its over-confidence stemming from data
memorization. We evaluate LoTUS on Transformer and ResNet18 models against
eight baselines across five public datasets. Beyond established MU benchmarks,
we evaluate unlearning on ImageNet1k, a large-scale dataset, where retraining
is impractical, simulating real-world conditions. Moreover, we introduce the
novel Retrain-Free Jensen-Shannon Divergence (RF-JSD) metric to enable
evaluation under real-world conditions. The experimental results show that
LoTUS outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both efficiency and
effectiveness. Code: https://github.com/cspartalis/LoTUS.
